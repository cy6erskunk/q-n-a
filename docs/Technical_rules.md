# Book 1: Technical Rules

## General Rules and Rules Common to the Three Weapons

### Chapter 1: Application of the Rules

**t.1**  
Definition of the fencer's salute:  
In competition, the fencer's salute is a gesture of civility towards the opponent, the referee, and the spectators. To perform the fencer's salute, the two fencers:

- Face each other.
- Stand still on their on-guard line.
- Place the mask under the non-sword arm.
- Lift the guard to the chin.
- Then lower the blade to the ground.

**Application:** Starting from 26 September 2023.

### Explanation of Some Technical Terms Most Commonly Used in the Judging of Fencing

**Preamble: t.7**  
It is stressed that this section in no way replaces a treatise on fencing and is only included to help the reader understand the rules.

**Fencing Time: t.8**  
Fencing time is the time required to perform one simple fencing action.

**Offensive and Defensive Actions: t.9**  

1. The offensive actions are the attack, the riposte, and the counter-riposte.
   - The attack is the initial offensive action made by extending the arm and continuously threatening the opponent’s target, preceding the launching of the lunge or flèche (cf. t.83, t.84, t.85 and t.101ss).
   - The riposte is the offensive action made by the fencer who has parried the attack.
   - The counter-riposte is the offensive action made by the fencer who has parried the riposte.
   
2. The defensive actions are the parries.
   - The parry is the defensive action made with the weapon to prevent an offensive action from arriving.

### The Attack

**t.10**  
- The action is simple when it is executed in one movement and is:
  - Either direct (in the same line).
  - Or indirect (in another line).
- The action is compound when it is executed in several movements.

---

### The Riposte

**t.11**  
The riposte may be immediate or delayed, depending on the action and the speed at which it is carried out.

1. **Simple, direct riposte**:
   - Direct riposte: A riposte that hits the opponent without leaving the line in which the parry was made.
   - Riposte along the blade: A riposte that hits the opponent by grazing along the blade after the parry.

2. **Simple, indirect riposte**:
   - Riposte by disengagement: Hits the opponent in the opposite line to where the parry was formed.
   - Riposte with a coupé: Hits in the opposite line, passing over the opponent’s point.

3. **Compound riposte**:
   - Riposte with a doublé: Hits in the opposite line after a circular movement around the blade.
   - Riposte with a one–two: Hits in the same line after first moving to the opposite line, passing under the opponent’s blade.

---

### Counter-Attacks

**t.12**  
Counter-attacks are offensive or offensive–defensive actions made during the opponent’s offensive action.

1. **The stop hit**: A counter-attack made into an attack.
2. **The stop hit made with opposition**: A counter-attack made while closing the line in which the opponent’s attack will be completed (cf. t.83, t.84, t.85, t.101ss and t.102ss).
3. **The stop hit made within a period of fencing time**, i.e. ‘in time’ (cf. t.88, t.105).

---

### Other Offensive Actions

**t.13**  
1. **The remise**: A simple and immediate offensive action that follows the original attack without withdrawing the arm, after the opponent has parried or retreated, when the latter has either quitted contact with the blade without riposting or has made a riposte which is delayed, indirect or compound.
2. **The redoublement**: A new action, either simple or compound, made against an opponent who has parried without riposting or who has merely avoided the first action by retreating or displacing the target.
3. **The reprise of the attack**: A new attack executed immediately after returning to the on-guard position.
4. **Counter-time**: Any action made by the attacker against a stop hit made by his opponent.

---

### Defensive Actions

**t.14**  
Parries are simple when they are made in the same line as the attack.
They are circular (counter-parries) when they are made in the opposite line to that of the attack.

---

### The Point in Line Position

**t.15**  
The point in line position is a specific position in which the fencer’s sword arm is kept straight and the point of his weapon continually threatens his opponent’s valid target (cf. t.84.1/2/3, t.89.4.e, t.89.5.a, t.102, t.103.3.e, t.106.4.a/b).

### Chapter 3: The Field of Play

**t.16** - **t.19**  
(Details about the dimensions and setup of the fencing piste.)

---

## Chapter 4: The Fencer’s Equipment (Weapons — Equipment — Clothing)

### Responsibility of Fencers

**t.20**

1. Fencers arm, equip and clothe themselves and fence at their own responsibility and at their own risk.

2. It is obligatory for any fencer who warms up or trains with another fencer on site at an official FIE competition (including in the training halls linked to the competition) to wear fencing clothing and equipment which conforms with the FIE regulations.

   - Any person giving a lesson must wear at least a fencing master’s plastron as well as a fencing glove and a mask conforming with the regulations.
   - Any fencer taking a lesson must wear at least a mask and a glove.
   - The Supervisor of the competition or a member of the Directoire Technique must penalize any person not respecting this rule with a yellow card, followed by a black card in case of a repeated infringement.

3. The safety measures specified in the Rules and in the standards contained in the annexe to them and the methods of control laid down in the present Rules (cf. Material Rules) are only designed to reinforce the fencers’ safety and cannot guarantee it. They cannot, therefore, whatever the manner in which they are applied, impart responsibility to the FIE, or to the organisers of competitions, to the officials or personnel who carry out such organisation, or to those who may cause an accident.

## Chapter 5: Fencing

### Method of Holding the Weapon

**t.21**

1. With all three weapons, defensive actions must be affected exclusively with the weapon.

2. If the handle has no special device or attachment or special shape (e.g. orthopedic), a fencer may hold it in any way he wishes and he may also alter the position of his hand on the handle during a bout. However, the weapon must not be — either permanently or temporarily, in an open or disguised manner — transformed into a throwing weapon; it must be used without the hand leaving the handle and without the hand slipping along the handle from front to back during an offensive action.

3. When the handle has a special device or attachment or has a special shape (e.g. orthopedic) it must be held in such a way that the upper surface of the thumb is in the same plane as the groove in the blade (at foil or at epée) and perpendicular to the plane of flexibility of the blade at sabre.

4. The weapon must be used with one hand only; a fencer may not change hands before the end of the bout, unless the Referee gives special permission in the case of injury to the hand or arm.

---

### Coming on Guard and Placing of the Fencers

**t.22**

1. The fencer whose number is called first should place himself on the right of the Referee, except in the case of a bout between a right- and a left-hander, if the left-hander is called first.

2. The team which has the greater number of right-handed fencers should be placed on the referee’s right. If both teams have the same number of right- and left-handed fencers, the team called first should be placed on the referee’s right.

3. The Referee places each of the two competitors in such a way that the front foot of each is immediately behind the ‘on-guard’ line.

4. Competitors are always put on guard, whether at the beginning of the bout or subsequently, in the centre of the width of the piste.

5. When placed on guard during the bout, the distance between the two competitors must be such that, in the position ‘point in line’, the points of the two blades cannot make contact.

6. After the scoring of a valid hit the competitors are put on guard in the middle of the piste.

7. If no hit is awarded they are replaced in the position which they occupied when the bout was interrupted.

8. At the beginning of each period (in a direct elimination bout) and of any additional minute of fencing time, the fencers are placed on guard in the middle of the piste.

9. If a fencer has crossed the lateral boundaries of the piste, with one or both feet, he must be placed on guard at the correct distance even if this means that he is placed behind the rear line and thus causes a hit to be awarded against him.

10. Competitors come on guard when the Referee gives the order ‘On guard!’, after which the Referee asks, ‘Are you ready?’. On receiving an affirmative reply, or in the absence of a negative reply, he gives the command for fencing to commence with the word ‘Play!’.

11. The fencers must come on guard correctly and remain completely still until the command ‘Play!’ is given by the Referee.

12. At foil and sabre fencers may not come on guard in the ‘in line’ position.

---

### Beginning, Stopping, and Restarting the Bout

**t.23**

1. The start of the bout is signalled by the word ‘Play!’. No movement made or initiated before the word ‘Play!’ is counted.

2. The bout stops on the word ‘Halt!’, except in the case of special events occurring which modify the regular and normal conditions of the bout.

3. Directly the order ‘Halt!’ has been given, a competitor may not start a new action; only a movement which has been begun before the order was given remains valid. Everything which takes place afterwards is absolutely not valid.

4. If a competitor stops before the word ‘Halt!’, and is hit, the hit is valid.

5. The order ‘Halt!’ is also given if the play of the competitors is dangerous, confused, or contrary to the Rules, if one of the competitors is disarmed or steps off the piste.

6. The Referee may not allow a fencer to leave the piste, save in exceptional circumstances. If a competitor does so without permission he is liable to incur the penalties enumerated in Articles t.158-162, t.165, t.170, for the offences of the 1st group.

---

### Fencing at Close Quarters

**t.24**

Fencing at close quarters is allowed so long as the competitors can wield their weapons correctly and the Referee can, at foil and sabre, follow the phrase.

---

### Corps à Corps

**t.25**

1. Corps à corps is said to exist when the two competitors are in contact; when this occurs the Referee must stop the bout.

2. At all three weapons it is forbidden for a fencer to cause corps à corps intentionally to avoid being hit, or to jostle his opponent. Should such an offence occur, the Referee will penalise the fencer at fault as specified in Articles t.158-162, t.165, t.170, for the offences of the 1st group and any hit scored by the fencer at fault is annulled.

3. A fencer who either by a flèche attack or by advancing vigorously brings about a corps à corps even several times in succession (without brutality or violence) does not transgress the basic conventions of fencing and commits no fault thereby.

---

### Corps à Corps and Fleche Attacks

**t.26**

1. The ‘flèche ending systematically in a corps à corps’ referred to in this article must not be confused with the ‘flèche resulting in a shock which jostles the opponent’, which is considered as an act of intentional brutality at all three weapons and is punished as such, for the offences of the 2nd group.

2. On the other hand, the ‘flèche which is made by running, even going past the opponent’, and without a corps à corps, is not forbidden: the Referee should not call ‘Halt!’ too soon, in order not to annul a possible riposte; if, when making such a running flèche without hitting his opponent, the fencer who makes the flèche crosses the lateral boundaries of the piste, he must be punished as laid down in Article t.35.3.

---

### Displacing the Target and Passing the Opponent

**t.27**

1. Displacing the target and ducking are allowed even if during the action the unarmed hand and/or the knee of the rear leg comes into contact with the piste.

2. It is forbidden to turn one’s back on one’s opponent during the bout. Should such an offence occur, the Referee will penalise the fencer at fault as specified in articles t.158-162, t.165, t.170, for the offences of the 1st group and any hit scored by the fencer at fault is annulled.

---

### Substitution and Use of the Non-Sword Hand and Arm

**t.29**

1. The use of the non-sword hand and arm to carry out an offensive or defensive action is forbidden. Should such an offence occur, the hit scored by the fencer at fault is annulled and the latter will be penalized as specified for offences of the 2nd group (red card).

2. If a fencer substitutes a non-valid part of his target for a valid part, either by covering it or by any abnormal movement, the Referee must penalise him by applying the penalties specified in Articles t.158-162, t.165, t.170, for the offences of the 1st group and any hit scored by the fencer at fault is annulled.

3. During the fight, the fencer must not, under any circumstances, take hold of any part of the electrical equipment with his non-sword hand; the referee imposes the penalties for the offences of the first group. Any hit scored by the fencer at fault is annulled.

---

### Ground Gained or Lost

**t.31**

When the order ‘Halt!’ is given, ground gained is held until a hit has been given. When competitors are replaced on guard, each fencer should retire an equal distance in order to keep fencing distance.

---

### Crossing the Limits of the Piste

**t.33**

1. When a competitor crosses one of the lateral boundaries of the piste with one or both feet completely off the piste, the Referee must immediately call ‘Halt!’.

2. If the fencer goes off the piste with both feet, the Referee must annul everything that has occurred after the boundary has been crossed, except a hit received by the competitor who has crossed the boundary even after he has crossed it, provided that this hit results from a simple and immediate action.

---

### Duration of the Bout

Here is **Chapter 5**, starting from **Article t.37** until the end of the chapter, converted without modifications or rephrasing:

---

### Duration of the Bout

**t.37**

1. Duration of the bout is held to mean the effective duration, that is the total of the intervals of time between the orders ‘Play!’ and ‘Halt!’.

2. The duration of the bout is controlled by the Referee or by a time-keeper. For the finals of all official competitions, as well as for all bouts for which a chronometer is visible to the spectators, the chronometer must be so placed that it is visible to the two fencers on the piste and to the Referee.

3. The same bout or relay cannot be restarted after the bout or relay is finished in accordance with t.122, even if a formal mistake has been made.

**t.38**  
In the pools a bout ends when:  
1. One of the fencers has scored 5 hits.  
a) In this case the score registered on the score-sheet is the final score of the bout (V – n, where n = the number of hits scored by the losing fencer).  
b) At épée, if the two fencers reach a score of 4–4, they must fence for a deciding hit, up to the time limit. Any double hit will not be counted (and the fencers will therefore remain where they are on the piste).

2. Three minutes of effective fencing time have passed.  
a) If when the time limit expires there is a difference of at least one hit between the scores of the two fencers, the fencer who has scored the greater number of hits is declared winner. The score registered on the score-sheet is the actual score achieved in the bout (VN – n, where N = the number of hits scored by the winning fencer and n = the number of hits scored by the losing fencer).

b) If at the end of regulation time the scores are equal, the fencers fence for a deciding hit, with a maximum time limit of one minute. Before the fencing recommences, the Referee draws lots to decide who will be the winner if scores are still equal at the end of the extra minute.

c) In this case the score registered on the score-sheet is always the actual score achieved in the bout: — VN – n if a deciding hit is scored within the time limit for the bout; — V4 – 4 or V3 – 3 or V2 – 2 or V1 – 1 or V0 – 0 if the winner is designated by drawing lots.

**t.39**  
1. The direct elimination bouts are for 15 hits or end when the three periods of three minutes, with a one-minute rest between each period, have passed. As an exception, at sabre, the first period ends either at the expiry of the three minutes or when one of the fencers has scored eight hits.

2. During the one-minute rests, a person named before the bout, may have access to the fencer.

3. A clock, incorporated into the electrical scoring apparatus, blocks the latter at the end of each period.

**t.40**  
1. The bout ends when:
   - One of the fencers has scored 15 hits; or
   - 9 minutes of effective fencing time have passed.

2. The fencer who has scored the greater number of hits is declared the winner.

3. If at the end of regulation time the scores are equal, the fencers fence for a deciding hit, with a maximum time limit of one minute. Before the fencing recommences the Referee draws lots to decide who will be the winner if scores are still equal at the end of the extra minute.

4. In this case the score recorded on the score-sheet is the real score achieved in the bout.

---

### Team Competitions

**t.41**

1. Each ‘lap’ (bout) of the relay match consists of five hits (5, 10, 15, 20, etc.). Exceptionally, a relay may end at more than 5, 10, 15 etc. if a fencer scores a valid last hit of the relay and is at the same time awarded an additional penalty hit: in this case both hits will be counted; the maximum time for each bout is 3 minutes.

2. The first two opponents fence until one or both have scored five hits, within the time limit of 3 minutes.

3. The next two opponents fence until one or both* of their scores has reached ten hits, within the time limit of 3 minutes, and so on with successive bouts, cumulatively, of five hits.

4. The winning team is that which first reaches the maximum score of 45 hits, or that which has scored the greatest number of hits after the expiry of regulation time.

5. If at the end of regulation time for the last bout the scores are equal, the match continues for a deciding hit, with a maximum time limit of one minute, fought for by the fencers of the last bout in the match. Before the fencing recommences the Referee draws lots to decide who will be the winner if scores are still equal at the end of the extra minute.

---

### Veterans

**t.42**  
The direct elimination bouts are for 10 hits or end when two periods of three minutes, with one minute rest between the periods, have passed. As an exception, at sabre, the first period ends either at the expiry of the three minutes or when one of the fencers has scored five hits.

---

### Timing

**t.43**

1. The fencers may ask how much time they have left to fence each time that the fencing is interrupted.

2. Any fencer who attempts improperly to cause or to prolong interruptions to the bout is penalised as specified in Articles t.158-162, t.165, t.170, for the offences of the 1st group.

---
Here is **Article t.44** fully converted into **Markdown**, without any rephrasing or modifications:

---

**t.44**

1. At the expiry of the regulation fencing time, the clock must set off automatically a loud audible signal, and automatically cut off the scoring apparatus, without cancelling hits registered before the disconnection. The bout stops with the audible signal.

2. If the clock is not linked to the scoring apparatus, the time-keeper must shout ‘Halt!’ (or operate a sound signal) which stops the fight; in this case even a ‘coup lancé’ is not valid.

3. The referee must operate the time-keeping throughout the match. Should there be a failure of the clock, the Referee must himself estimate how much fencing time is left. He must be able to reset the time manually and if necessary to reset the time to that previously shown to the nearest 1/100 of a second.

4. When wireless apparatus is used, no hits registered after the end of fencing time will be awarded even if a lamp is showing on the wireless apparatus.

### Injuries or Other Medical Reasons, Withdrawal of a Competitor

**t.45**

1. For any injury or other medical reason which occurs in the course of a bout and which is properly attested by the delegate of the FIE Medical Commission or, in his/her absence, by the doctor and/or medical provider on duty, the Referee will allow a break in the fight lasting no longer than 5 minutes. Only the doctor and/or medical provider on duty can determine the length of time of treatment required when a medical time-out is granted. This break should be timed from the intervention of the delegate of the FIE Medical commission or, in his absence, the doctor. This break should be strictly reserved for the requisite treatment. If the delegate of the FIE Medical Commission or, in his absence, the doctor on duty considers, before or at the end of the 5 minute break, that the fencer is incapable of continuing the fight, he/she will decide that the fencer should retire (individual events) and/or be replaced, if possible (team events) (cf. o.99.6.a/b).

   If the athlete retires and a medical withdrawal is determined, the FIE Medical delegate or, in his/her absence, the doctor or medical provider on duty must fully complete the FIE Medical Withdrawal form and submit it to the Directoire Technique for its inclusion into the FIE supervisor’s final report.

   All breaks for a medical reason must be noted on the score-sheet for the bout, the pool or the match.

2. During the remainder of the same day, a fencer cannot be allowed a further break unless as a result of a different injury or other medical reason.

3. Should a fencer demand a break which is deemed by the delegate of the Medical Commission or, in his absence, by the doctor on duty to be unjustified, the Referee will penalise that fencer as specified in Articles t.158-162, t.166, t.170 for the offences of the 2nd group.

4. In team events a fencer judged unable to continue the bout by the delegate of the FIE Medical Commission or, in his absence, by the doctor on duty may, nevertheless, on the advice of the same delegate of the FIE Medical Commission/doctor, fight in subsequent matches on the same day.

5. The Directoire Technique may modify the order of bouts in a pool in order to ensure the efficient running of the competition (cf. o.71.1).
