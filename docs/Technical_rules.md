## APPLICATION OF THE RULES 

t.1 

Definition of the fencer's salute 

In competition, the fencer's salute is a gesture of civility towards the opponent, the referee and the spectators. To perform the fencer's salute, the two fencers: 

- face each other 

- stand still on their on-guard line 

- place the mask under the non-sword arm 

- lift the guard to the chin 

- then lower the blade to the ground

EXPLANATION OF SOME TECHNICAL TERMS MOST COMMONLY USED IN THE JUDGING OF FENCING 

Preamble 

t.7 It is stressed that this section in no way replaces a treatise on fencing and is only included in order to help the reader understand the rules. 

Fencing time 

t.8 

Fencing time is the time required to perform one simple fencing action. 

Offensive and defensive actions 

t.9 

Definition: FIE 

6

November 2023 

1 The offensive actions are the attack, the riposte and the counter-riposte. 

- The attack is the initial offensive action made by extending the arm and continuously threatening the opponent’s target, preceding the launching of the lunge or flèche (cf. t.83, t.84, t.85 and t.101ss). 

- The riposte is the offensive action made by the fencer who has parried the attack. 

- The counter-riposte is the offensive action made by the fencer who has parried the riposte. 

2 The defensive actions are the parries. 

- The parry is the defensive action made with the weapon to prevent an offensive action arriving. 

Explanation: 

Offensive actions: 

The attack 

t.10 

The action is simple when it is executed in one movement and is 

- either direct (in the same line) 

- or indirect (in another line). 

The action is compound when it is executed in several movements. 

The riposte 

t.11 The riposte may be immediate or delayed , depending on what action takes place and the speed at which it is carried out. Ripostes are: 

1 Simple, direct 

- Direct riposte: a riposte which hits the opponent without leaving the line in which the parry was made. 

- Riposte along the blade : a riposte which hits the opponent by grazing along the blade after the parry. 

2 Simple, indirect 

- Riposte by disengagement : a riposte which hits the opponent in the opposite line to that in which the parry was formed (by passing under the opponent’s blade if the parry was formed in the high line, and over the blade if the parry was formed in the low line). 

- Riposte with a coupé : a riposte which hits the opponent in the opposite line to that in which the parry was formed (the blade always passing over the opponent’s point). 

3 Compound 

- Riposte with a doublé : a riposte which hits the opponent in the opposite line to that in which the parry was formed, but after having described a complete circle round the opponent’s blade. 

- Riposte with a one–two : a riposte which hits the opponent in the same line as that in which the parry was formed but after the blade has first been into the opposite line, by passing under the opponent’s blade. 

Counter-attacks 

t.12 Counter-attacks are offensive or offensive–defensive actions made during the offensive action of the opponent. 

1 The stop hit: a counter-attack made into an attack. 

2 The stop hit made with opposition: a counter-attack made while closing the line in which the opponent’s attack will be completed (cf. t.83, t.84, t.85, t.101ss and t.102ss). 

3 The stop hit made within a period of fencing time , i.e. ‘in time’ (cf. t.88, t.105). FIE 

7

November 2023 

Other offensive actions 

t.13 

1 The remise 

A simple and immediate offensive action which follows the original attack, without withdrawing the arm , after the opponent has parried or retreated, when the latter has either quitted contact with the blade without riposting or has made a riposte which is delayed, indirect or compound. 

2 The redoublement 

A new action , either simple or compound, made against an opponent who has parried without riposting or who has merely avoided the first action by retreating or displacing the target. 

3 The reprise of the attack 

A new attack executed immediately after a return to the on-guard position .

4 Counter-time 

Any action made by the attacker against a stop hit made by his opponent. 

Defensive actions 

t.14 Parries are simple, direct, when they are made in the same line as the attack. 

They are circular ( counter-parries) when they are made in the opposite line to that of the attack. 

The point in line position 

t.15 

The point in line position is a specific position in which the fencer’s sword arm is kept straight and the point of his weapon continually threatens his opponent’s valid target (cf. t.84.1/2/3, t.89.4.e, t.89.5.a, t.102, t.103.3.e, t.106.4.a/b). 

Chapter 3 

## THE FIELD OF PLAY 

t.16 The field of play should have an even surface. It should give neither advantage nor disadvantage to either of the two fencers concerned, especially as regards light. 

t.17 

1 That portion of the field of play which is used for fencing is called the piste. 

2 Competitions at all three weapons are fenced on the same pistes. 

t.18 

1 The combat area of the piste is 1.50 meters wide .FIE 

8

November 2023 

2 The piste is 14 metres long , with a total tolerance on the whole length of 4 cm, so that each competitor , being placed at 2 metres from the centre line , has at his disposal for retreating a total distance of 5 metres without it being necessary for him to cross the rear limit of the piste with both feet. 

3 The conductive safety borders, indicated in Fig. 1, the diagram of the pistes for poules, DE, finals and semi-finals, including the pistes already having safety borders, do not form part of the piste. 

4 The distance between the score machine table or stand and the edge of the piste should be between 1 meter and 5 meters. Any slave score machine must not be placed nearer than 5 meters from the edge of the runback area. FIE 

9

November 2023 

t.19 Five lines should be drawn very clearly on the piste at right angles to its length, as follows: 

1 one centre line which must be drawn as a broken line across the whole width of the piste; 

2 two on-guard lines at 2 metres on each side of the centre line. These must be drawn across the whole width of the piste; 

3 two lines at the rear limits of the piste, which must be drawn across the whole width of the piste, at a distance of 7 metres from the centre line. 

4 In addition, the last 2 metres of the piste before these rear limit lines must be clearly distinguished — if possible by a different colour of piste — to make it easy for the fencers to be aware of their position on the piste (see Figures 1 and 2). 

## Chapter 4 

## THE FENCER’S EQUIPMENT (Weapons — Equipment — Clothing) 

Responsibility of fencers 

t.20 

1 Fencers arm, equip and clothe themselves and fence at their own responsibility and at their own risk .

2 It is obligatory for any fencer who warms up or trains with another fencer on site at an official FIE competition (including in the training halls linked to the competition) to wear fencing clothing and equipment which conforms with the FIE regulations. 

Any person giving a lesson must wear at least a fencing master’s plastron as well as a fencing glove and a mask conforming with the regulations. 

Any fencer taking a lesson must wear at least a mask and a glove. 

The Supervisor of the competition or a member of the Directoire Technique must penalize any person not respecting this rule with a yellow card, followed by a black card in case of a repeated infringement. 

3 The safety measures specified in the Rules and in the standards contained in the annexe to them and the methods of control laid down in the present Rules (cf. Material Rules) are only designed to reinforce the fencers’ safety and cannot guarantee it. They cannot, therefore, whatever the manner in which they are applied, impart responsibility to the FIE, or to the organisers of competitions, to the officials or personnel who carry out such organisation, or to those who may cause an accident. 

## Chapter 5 

## FENCING 

Method of holding the weapon 

t.21 1 With all three weapons, defensive actions must be affected exclusively with the weapon. 

2 If the handle has no special device or attachment or special shape (e.g. orthopedic), a fencer 

may hold it in any way he wishes and he may also alter the position of his hand on the handle during a bout. However, the weapon must not be — either permanently or temporarily, in an open or disguised manner — transformed into a throwing weapon ; it must be used without the hand leaving the handle and without the hand slipping along the handle from front FIE 

10 

November 2023 

to back during an offensive action. 

3 When the handle has a special device or attachment or has a special shape (e.g. orthopedic) it must be held in such a way that the upper surface of the thumb is in the same plane as the groove in the blade (at foil or at epée) and perpendicular to the plane of flexibility of the blade at sabre. 

4 The weapon must be used with one hand only ; a fencer may not change hands before the end of the bout, unless the Referee gives special permission in the case of injury to the hand or arm. 

Coming on guard and placing of the fencers 

t.22 

1 The fencer whose number is called first should place himself on the right of the Referee, except in the case of a bout between a right- and a left-hander, if the left-hander is called first. 

2 The team which has the greater number of right-handed fencers should be placed on the referee’s right. If both teams have the same number of right- and left-handed fencers, the team called first should be placed on the referee’s right. 

3 The Referee places each of the two competitors in such a way that the front foot of each is immediately behind the ‘on-guard’ line. 

4 Competitors are always put on guard, whether at the beginning of the bout or subsequently, in the centre of the width of the piste .

5 When placed on guard during the bout, the distance between the two competitors must be such that, in the position ‘point in line’, the points of the two blades cannot make contact. 

6 After the scoring of a valid hit the competitors are put on guard in the middle of the piste. 

7 If no hit is awarded they are replaced in the position which they occupied when the bout was interrupted. 

8 At the beginning of each period (in a direct elimination bout) and of any additional minute 

of fencing time, the fencers are placed on guard in the middle of the piste. 

The competitors may not be replaced on guard, at their correct distance , in such a way as to place behind the rear line of the piste a fencer who was in front of that line when the bout was halted. If he already had one foot behind the rear line, he remains in that position. 

9 If a fencer has crossed the lateral boundaries of the piste, with one or both feet, he must be placed on guard at the correct distance even if this means that he is placed behind the rear line and thus causes a hit to be awarded against him. (cf t.35.1, t.146). 

10 Competitors come on guard when the Referee gives the order ‘ On guard! ’, after which the Referee asks, ‘ Are you ready? ’. On receiving an affirmative reply, or in the absence of a negative reply, he gives the command for fencing to commence with the word ‘ Play! ’. 

11 The fencers must come on guard correctly and remain completely still until the command ‘Play!’ is given by the Referee. 

12 At foil and sabre fencers may not come on guard in the ‘ in line ’ position. FIE 

11 

November 2023 

Beginning, stopping and restarting the bout 

t.23 

1 The start of the bout is signalled by the word ‘Play!’. No movement made or initiated before the word ‘Play!’ is counted. 

2 The bout stops on the word ‘Halt!’, except in the case of special events occurring which modify the regular and normal conditions of the bout (cf. also t.44.1/2). 

3 Directly the order ‘ Halt! ’ has been given, a competitor may not start a new action; only a movement which has been begun before the order was given remains valid. Everything which takes place afterwards is absolutely not valid (But cf. t.44.1/2). 

4 If a competitor stops before the word ‘Halt!’, and is hit, the hit is valid. 

5 The order ‘Halt!’ is also given if the play of the competitors is dangerous, confused, or 

contrary to the Rules , if one of the competitors is disarmed or steps off the piste (cf. t.33, t.58). 

6 The Referee may not allow a fencer to leave the piste , save in exceptional circumstances. If a competitor does so without permission he is liable to incur the penalties enumerated in Articles t.158-162, t.165, t.170, for the offences of the 1st group. 

Fencing at close quarters 

t.24 

Fencing at close quarters is allowed so long as the competitors can wield their weapons correctly and the Referee can, at foil and sabre, follow the phrase. 

Corps à corps 

t.25 

1 Corps à corps is said to exist when the two competitors are in contact; when this occurs the Referee must stop the bout (cf. t.32, t.26). 

2 At all three weapons it is forbidden for a fencer to cause corps à corps intentionally 

to avoid being hit, or to jostle his opponent. Should such an offence occur, the Referee will penalise the fencer at fault as specified in Articles t.158-162, t.165, t.170, for the offences of the 1st group and any hit scored by the fencer at fault is annulled. 

3 A fencer who either by a flèche attack or by advancing vigorously brings about a corps à corps even several times in succession (without brutality or violence ) does not transgress the basic conventions of fencing and commits no fault thereby (cf. t.32). 

Corps à corps and fleche attacks 

t.26 

1 The ‘flèche ending systematically in a corps à corps’ referred to in this article must not be confused with the ‘flèche resulting in a shock which jostles the opponent’, which is considered as an act of intentional brutality at all three weapons and is punished as such (cf. t.121.2, t.170), for the offences of the 2nd group. 

2 On the other hand the ‘ flèche which is made by running, even going past the opponent’, and without a corps à corps , is not forbidden: the Referee should not call ‘Halt!’ too soon, in order not to annul a possible riposte; if, when making such a running flèche without hitting his opponent, the fencer who makes the flèche crosses the lateral boundaries of the piste, he must be punished as laid down in Article t.35.3. FIE 

12 

November 2023 

Displacing the target and passing the opponent 

t.27 

1 Displacing the target and ducking are allowed even if during the action the unarmed hand and/or the knee of the rear leg comes into contact with the piste. 

2 It is forbidden to turn one’s back on one’s opponent during the bout. Should such an offence occur, the Referee will penalise the fencer at fault as specified in articles t.158-162, t.165, t.170, for the offences of the 1st group and any hit scored by the fencer at fault is annulled. 

t.28 

1 When a fencer goes completely past his opponent during a bout, the Referee must immediately call ‘Halt!’ and replace the competitors in the positions which they occupied before the passing took place. 

2 When hits are made as a fencer passes his opponent , the hit made immediately is valid; a hit made after passing his opponent by the competitor who has made the passing movement is annulled, but the hit made immediately, even when turning round, by the competitor who has been subjected to the offensive action, is valid. 

3 If during a bout a fencer who has made a flèche attack has a hit registered against him and he continues to run beyond the extreme limit of the piste sufficiently far to cause his spool or the connecting line to his spool to be torn out , the hit which he has received will not be annulled (cf. t.147). 

Substitution and use of the non-sword hand and arm 

t.29 

1 The use of the non-sword hand and arm to carry out an offensive or defensive action is forbidden (cf t.158-162, t.166 , t.170). Should such an offence occur, the hit scored by the fencer at fault is annulled and the latter will be penalized as specified for offences of the 2nd group (red card). 

2 If a fencer substitutes a non-valid part of his target for a valid part , either by covering it or by any abnormal movement, the Referee must penalise him by applying the penalties specified in Articles t.158-162, t.165, t.170, for the offences of the 1st group and any hit scored by the fencer at fault is annulled. 

3 During the fight, the fencer must not, under any circumstances, take hold of any part of the electrical equipment with his non-sword hand the referee imposes him/her the penalties for the offences of the first group (cf. t.158-162, t.165, t.170); any hit scored by the fencer at fault is annulled. 

t.30 

1 If during a bout the Referee notices that one of the fencers is making use of his non-sword arm and/or hand, or is protecting or covering the valid target with a non-valid surface, he can call for the help of two neutral judges who will be designated by the Directoire Technique. 

2 These judges, one on each side of the piste, will watch all aspects of the fight and will indicate, by raising their hand or when asked by the Referee, if the non-sword arm or hand has been used, or if the fencer has protected or covered the valid target with a non-valid surface (cf. t.79, t.98, t.158-162, t.165, t.170). 

3 The Referee may also make the fencers change places so that the fencer committing this fault does not have his back to the Referee. 

Ground gained or lost 

t.31 When the order ‘Halt!’ is given, ground gained is held until a hit has been given. When competitors are replaced on guard, each fencer should retire an equal distance in order FIE 

13 

November 2023 

to keep fencing distance (cf. t.22.3/4). 

t.32 However, if the bout has been stopped on account of corps à corps , the fencers are replaced on guard in such a position that the competitor who has sustained the corps à corps is at the place which he previously occupied; this also applies if his opponent has subjected him to a flèche attack, even without corps à corps. 

Crossing the limits of the piste 

Stopping the bout 

t.33 

1 When a competitor crosses one of the lateral boundaries of the piste with one or both feet completely off the piste , the Referee must immediately call ‘Halt!’ 

2 If the fencer goes off the piste with both feet , the Referee must annul everything that has occurred after the boundary has been crossed, except a hit received by the competitor who has crossed the boundary even after he has crossed it, provided that this hit results from a simple and immediate action. 

3 However, a hit scored by the fencer who leaves the piste with one foot only is valid provided that the action was started before the ‘Halt!’. 

4 If one of the competitors leaves the piste with both feet , only a hit made by the fencer who remains on the piste with at least one foot, and at epee only, can be counted valid, even in the case of a double hit. For foil and sabre the convention must be applied. 

Rear limits 

t.34 Should a competitor cross the rear limit of the piste completely- i.e. with both feet — a hit will be scored against him. 

Lateral boundaries 

t.35 

1 If a competitor crosses one of the lateral boundaries of the piste with one or both feet , he must step back one metre from the point where he left the piste; and if he goes off the piste during an attack he must return to the position he occupied when he started his attack and then step back a further metre (but cf t.36). 

2 If the exercise of this penalty places a competitor with both feet beyond the rear limit of the piste, that competitor is considered as having been hit. 

3 A competitor who crosses one of the lateral boundaries of the piste with both feet — e.g. when making a flèche — to avoid being hit will be penalised as specified in Articles t.158-162, t.165, t.170, for the offences of the 1st group. Any hit made by the offending fencer is annulled. 

Leaving the piste accidentally 

t.36 

A competitor who involuntarily crosses one of the boundaries of the piste as the result of any accidental cause (such as jostling) incurs no penalty whatever. 

Duration of the bout 

t.37 

1 Duration of the bout is held to mean the effective duration , that is the total of the intervals of time between the orders ‘Play!’ and ‘Halt!’. 

2 The duration of the bout is controlled by the Referee or by a time-keeper. For the finals of all official competitions, as well as for all bouts for which a chronometer is visible to the FIE 

14 

November 2023 

spectators, the chronometer must be so placed that it is visible to the two fencers on the piste and to the Referee. 

3 The same bout or relay cannot be restarted after the bout or relay is finished in accordance with t.122, even if a formal mistake has been made. 

t.38 

In the pools a bout ends when: 

1 One of the fencers has scored 5 hits .

a) In this case the score registered on the score-sheet is the final score of the bout (V – n, where n = the number of hits scored by the losing fencer). 

b) At épée , if the two fencers reach a score of 4–4, they must fence for a deciding hit, up to the time limit. Any double hit will not be counted (and the fencers will therefore remain where they are on the piste). 

2 Three minutes of effective fencing time have passed. 

a) If when the time limit expires there is a difference of at least one hit between the scores of the two fencers, the fencer who has scored the greater number of hits is declared winner. The score registered on the score-sheet is the actual score achieved in the bout ( VN – n, where N = the number of hits scored by the winning fencer and n = the number of hits scored by the losing fencer). 

b) If at the end of regulation time the scores are equal , the fencers fence for a deciding hit, with a maximum time limit of one minute. Before the fencing recommences, the Referee draws lots to decide who will be the winner if scores are still equal at the end of the extra minute. 

c) In this case the score registered on the score-sheet is always the actual score achieved in the bout : — VN – n if a deciding hit is scored within the time limit for the bout; — V4 – 4 or V3 – 3 or V2 – 2 or V1 – 1 or V0 – 0 if the winner is designated by drawing lots. 

t.39 

1 The direct elimination bouts are for 15 hits or end when the three periods of three minutes, with a one-minute rest between each period, have passed. As an exception, at sabre, the first period ends either at the expiry of the three minutes or when one of the fencers has scored eight hits. 

2 During the one-minute rests, a person named before the bout, may have access to the fencer. 

3 A clock, incorporated into the electrical scoring apparatus , blocks the latter at the end of each period. 

t.40 

1 The bout ends when: 

- One of the fencers has scored 15 hits ; or 

- 9 minutes of effective fencing time have passed. 

2 The fencer who has scored the greater number of hits is declared the winner. 

3 If at the end of regulation time the scores are equal, the fencers fence for a deciding hit, with a maximum time limit of one minute. Before the fencing recommences the Referee draws lots to decide who will be the winner if scores are still equal at the end of the extra minute. 

4 In this case the score recorded on the score-sheet is the real score achieved in the bout. 

Team competitions 

t.41 

1 Each ‘lap’ (bout) of the relay match consists of five hits (5, 10, 15, 20, etc.). Exceptionally, a FIE 

15 

November 2023 

relay may end at more than 5, 10, 15 etc. if a fencer scores a valid last hit of the relay and is at the same time awarded an additional penalty hit: in this case both hits will be counted; the maximum time for each bout is 3 minutes .

2 The first two opponents fence until one or both have scored five hits, within the time limit of 3 minutes. 

The next two opponents fence until one or both* of their scores has reached ten hits, within the time limit of 3 minutes, and so on with successive bouts, cumulatively, of five hits.. 

3 If by the expiry of 3 minutes of fencing time the intended score for the bout has not been achieved , the next two fencers take up the score where it was left off and fence up to the maximum score intended for their bout as normal, within the time limit of 3 minutes. 

4 The winning team is that which first reaches the maximum score of 45 hits, or that which has scored the greatest number of hits after the expiry of regulation time. 

5 If at the end of regulation time for the last bout the scores are equal , the match continues for a deciding hit, with a maximum time limit of one minute, fought for by the fencers of the last bout in the match. Before the fencing recommences the Referee draws lots to decide who will be the winner if scores are still equal at the end of the extra minute. 

Veterans 

t.42 

The direct elimination bouts are for 10 hits or end when two periods of three minutes, with one minute rest between the periods, have passed. As an exception, at sabre, the first period ends either at the expiry of the three minutes or when one of the fencers has scored five hits. 

Timing 

t.43 

1 The fencers may ask how much time they have left to fence each time that the fencing is interrupted. 

2 Any fencer who attempts improperly to cause or to prolong interruptions to the bout is penalised as specified in Articles t.158-162, t.165, t.170, for the offences of the 1st group. 

t.44 

1 At the expiry of the regulation fencing time , the clock must set off automatically a loud audible signal, and automatically cut off the scoring apparatus, without cancelling hits registered before the disconnection. The bout stops with the audible signal. 

2 If the clock is not linked to the scoring apparatus , the time-keeper must shout ‘Halt!’ (or operate a sound signal) which stops the fight; in this case even a ‘coup lancé’ is not valid. 

3 The referee must operate the time-keeping throughout the match. Should there be a 

failure of the clock , the Referee must himself estimate how much fencing time is left. He must be able to reset the time manually and if necessary to reset the time to that previously shown to the nearest 1/100 of a second. 

4 When wireless apparatus is used, no hits registered after the end of fencing time will be awarded even if a lamp is showing on the wireless apparatus. 

Injuries and other medical reason , withdrawal of a competitor 

Injuries or other medical reason , withdrawal of a competitor

November 2023 

the doctor and/or medical provider on duty, the Referee will allow a break in the fight lasting no longer than 5 minutes. Only the doctor and/or medical provider on duty can determine the length of time of treatment required when a medical time-out is granted. This break should be timed from the intervention of the delegate of the FIE Medical commission or, in his absence, the doctor. gave his opinion. This break should be strictly reserved for the requisite treatment. If the delegate of the FIE Medical Commission or, in his absence, the doctor on duty considers, before or at the end of the 5 minute break, that the fencer is incapable of continuing the fight, he/ she will decide that the fencer should retire (individual events) and/or be replaced, if possible (team events) (cf. o.99.6.a/b). 

If the athlete retires and a medical withdrawal is determined, the FIE Medical delegate or, in his/her absence, the doctor or medical provider on duty must fully complete the FIE Medical Withdrawal form and submit it to the Directoire Technique for its inclusion into the FIE supervisor’s final report. 

All breaks for a medical reason must be noted on the score-sheet for the bout, the pool or the match. 

2. During the remainder of the same day, a fencer cannot be allowed a further break unless as a result of a different injury or other medical reason .

3. Should a fencer demand a break which is deemed by the delegate of the Medical Commission or, in his absence, by the doctor on duty to be unjustified , the Referee will penalise that fencer as specified in Articles t.158-162, t.166, t.170 for the offences of the 2nd group. 

4. In team events a fencer judged unable to continue the bout by the delegate of the FIE Medical Commission or, in his absence, by the doctor on duty may, nevertheless, on the advice of the same delegate of the FIE Medical Commission/doctor, fight in subsequent matches on the same day. 

5. The Directoire Technique may modify the order of bouts in a pool in order to ensure the efficient running of the competition (cf. o.71.1).

## REFEREEING AND JUDGING OF HITS 

t.46 

1 By accepting a position as referee or judge, the person so designated pledges his honour to respect the Rules and to cause them to be respected, and to carry out his duties with the strictest impartiality and absolute concentration. 

2 Referees may not combine their function with any other activity during the tournament, such as member of the Directoire Technique, team captain, official delegate of their national federation, trainer, etc. 

Referees 

t.47 

1 All bouts at fencing in official FIE competitions are directed by a referee who must be an FIE referee licensed for the current season. 

2 Duties of referees :

a) The Referee calls the roll of the competitors (cf. t.114, t.118, t.119). 

b) The Referee directs the bout. 

c) Before each bout, the Referee must check the weapons, clothes and equipment of the fencers, according to the regulations below. FIE 

17 

November 2023 

d) The Referee superintends the proper functioning of the electrical apparatus. Either on own initiative or when asked to do so by a team captain or competitor, the Referee implements tests necessary to check the apparatus and locate any faults which may be found. The Referee will prevent the competitors from hindering the tests by unplugging or changing their equipment prematurely. 

e) The Referee directs the judges, time-keepers, scorers, etc. 

f) The Referee positions himself and moves in such a way as to be able to follow the bout while always being able to see the illumination of the signal lamps. 

g) The Referee penalises faults (cf. t.164). 

h) The Referee awards the hits (cf. t. 54ss). 

i) The Referee maintains order (cf. t.137). 

j) Whenever necessary, the Referee should consult the experts concerning the electrical apparatus (cf. o.28). 

k) The Referee must also supervise the state of the conductive piste and not allow the bout to commence or to continue if the conductive piste has holes in it which might affect the proper registering of hits. 

Judges 

t.48 

1 The Referee fulfils his functions with the aid of an apparatus for the automatic registering of hits; he may also be assisted by two judges watching for the use of the unarmed hand or arm, substitution of the valid target, hits scored on the floor at épée, leaving the piste to the side or the rear or any other offence defined in the Rules (cf. t.170). 

2 The judges are obligatory for all individual competition finals (4 fencers) and for the final (2 teams) of team events. 

3 The judges are placed on each side of the Referee, on either side of the piste; they watch all aspects of the entire fight. 

4 The judges must change ends halfway through each bout or after each period in direct elimination bouts and after each bout in team matches, so as not to watch the same fencer the whole time. 

Video consultants 

t.49 Whenever video refereeing is used, there shall be designated video consultants who will watch the match live, then, should the need arise, subsequently on the video screen, and interact with the referee as specified in t.60-62, o.105. 

The video-consultant must: 

1. be a referee holding an FIE licence for the year in question; 

2. have been trained to assist with the video; 

3. be of a different nationality from the fencers on the piste; 

4. be of a different nationality from the main referee. 

Designations of referees and video consultants 

Individual competitions 

t.50 

1 For the rounds of pools and the direct elimination table, the Refereeing Delegates select the referees by drawing lots. 

2 For the pools , the referee must be of a different nationality from that any of the fencers in the pool. 

3 For the direct elimination tables at each weapon , the Refereeing Delegates establish, among the referees present, a list of the best referees at each weapon (according to the FIE 

18 

November 2023 

grades obtained during the season). 

For each quarter of the table, 4 referees are assigned by drawing lots from among at least of 4 to 5 referees, to referee the bouts in the order of the table, if possible. They must be of a different nationality from that of any of the fencers participating in that quarter of the table. 

Then, the video consultants will be assigned by drawing lots among a list of at least 4 to 5 referees. 

Lots are drawn by the computer at each stage of the table but may be modified by the Refereeing Delegates in case of any problem with the computer programme, mistakes made by the operator of the computer programme and in case of conflicts between category A or B (FIE Statutes, CHAPTER XII - ETHICAL CODE). In any case where the computer draw is modified, it must be with the agreement of the Directoire Technique and signed by both the Refereeing Delegate and the President of the DT. 

At each referees’ meeting before any competition, the referees will be asked to declare their potential conflicts of interest to the Refereeing Delegate or to the President of the Directoire technique (for junior competitions).This information must be notified to the FIE by the Refereeing Delegate or the Directoire technique President (for junior competitions). 

4 At the end of each round, the Refereeing Delegates can withdraw one or more referees whose performance was not satisfactory. This decision must be taken by the majority of the Refereeing Delegates present. However, a referee may not be changed during a bout except in exceptional circumstance. In such a case the decision, which must be well founded, must be taken by the majority of the Refereeing Delegates present (this rule is equally valid for team competitions). 

5 For the final of 4, the Refereeing Delegates, immediately after the end of the direct elimination tables, select 4 referees by lot from among at least a list of 4 to 5 referees, who must be of a different nationality from any of the fencers. 

15 minutes before the final, the Refereeing Delegates will draw lots to assign the referees for all the bouts at the same time, in the following order: 1 st semi-final, 2 nd semi-final. 

As soon as the two semi-finals are over, the Refereeing Delegates will establish a list of 4 or 5 referees and draw lots to assign the referee and video consultant for the final as well as (at the OG) the referee and video consultant for the 3 rd place bout. 

6 The drawing of lots is done with the help of a computer for the whole of the competition right through to the final. The computer programme must record each drawing of lots so that it is possible to know which referees were submitted for each draw. The computer programme should also be able to indicate whether the draw for any round was subsequently redone. 

7 In conformity with articles t.50.2 and t.50.3, the designation of the video-consultant must be made by drawing lots using a computer programme. The name and nationality of the video- consultant must also be written on the pool or match sheet, beside those of the referee. 

Team Competitions 

t.51 The same rules as those in article t.50, 3-7 are applied to the team competitions, with two referees per match. 

World Cup competitions 

t.52 The Rules described in t.50 and t.51 above are applied by the Directoire Technique, assisted for the finals by the official FIE Refereeing delegate. 

Method of judging hits 

Materiality of the hit 

t.53 

Competitions are judged with an electrical recording apparatus .

t.54 

1 The materiality of the hit is established according to the indications of the apparatus, FIE 

19 

November 2023 

and when necessary by consulting the judges (cf. t.48). 

2 Only the indications of the electrical apparatus as indicated by its own lamps or by the extension lamps can be taken into consideration for judging hits. Under no circumstances can the Referee declare a competitor to be hit unless the hit has been properly registered by the apparatus (except as provided for in Article t.79 or when a penalty hit has been awarded). 

3 On the other hand, the Referee should, in the cases enumerated for each weapon, annul a hit registered by the apparatus (cf. t.80ss, t.94ss, t.99). 

Annulment of a hit 

t.55 

1 The Referee will disregard hits which are registered as a result of actions: 

- started before the word ‘Play! ’ or after the word ‘Halt!’ (cf. t.23.1/3); 

- which are made on any object other than the opponent or his equipment. 

2 A competitor who, intentionally , causes the apparatus to register a hit by placing his point on the ground or on any surface other than that of his opponent will be penalised as specified in Articles t.158-162, t.166, t.170, for the offences of the 2nd group. 

t.56 

The Referee must also apply the following rules: 

1 Only the last hit made before the fault was established can be annulled and then only if it is the competitor against whom the hit was registered who is placed at a disadvantage by the failure. 

2 The failure must be established by tests made immediately after the bout was stopped, under the supervision of the Referee and without changing anything whatever of the equipment in use. 

3 A competitor who makes any modification in or who changes his equipment 

without being asked by the Referee to do so, before the Referee has given his decision, loses all right to the annulment of the hit. 

4 If the bout has effectively recommenced a competitor cannot claim the annulment of a hit awarded against him before the said recommencement of the bout. 

5 With these tests, one is trying only to establish whether there is material possibility of a mistake in the judgement as a result of a fault. The location of a fault found in the equipment (including the equipment of the competitors) is of no importance for this possible annulment. 

6 It is not necessary that the failure found should repeat itself each time a test is made; but it is essential that the fault should be observed by the Referee without the possibility of doubt at least once during the tests made by him or under his supervision. 

7 When a competitor against whom a hit has been registered has broken his blade , the hit must be annulled unless the breaking of the blade has occurred clearly after the hit has been registered. 

8 The Referee must pay particular attention to hits which do not register or which are registered abnormally . Should such defects be repeated, the Referee must ask amember of the SEMI Committee or an expert technician on duty to verify that the equipment conforms to the Rules. 

9 The Referee must ensure that nothing is altered in the competitors’ equipment or in the whole of the electrical apparatus before the expert carries out his check. 

10 Hit made during or after a fall must be annulled. 

11 A competitor who, intentionally drops his/her weapon during the fencing phrase will be penalised as specified in Articles t.166, t.170. However, a hit scored by the opponent is valid, provided that the action was started before the ‘Halt!’. FIE 

20 

November 2023 

t.57 Whenever accidental causes make it impossible to carry out tests, the hit will be considered 

doubtful and annulled. 

t.58 In accordance with the general rules ( cf. t.23.5 ) the Referee must stop the bout , even if no hit is registered by the apparatus, whenever the play becomes confused and he is no longer able to analyse the phrase. 

Validity or priority of the hit 

t.59 

1 As soon as the bout has stopped, the Referee briefly analyses the movements which composed the last fencing phrase. 

2 After reaching his decision regarding the materiality of a hit, the Referee, by applying the rules , decides which fencer was hit, whether both were hit (épée), or whether there was no valid hit ( cf. t.82ss, t.92, t.100 )

Appeals for Video Refereeing 

t.60 Both in team and individual events, only the fencer on the piste has the right to request a video review. 

t.61 

1 In the individual events , the fencer has: 

- in pools , one possible appeal during each bout; (cf. o.105, zonal qualification events for Olympic Games). 

- in direct elimination bouts, two possible appeals. 

Should the referee agree with the fencer who appealed for the video-refereeing, the latter is entitled to retain the right of appeal. 

2 In team events , the fencers have one possible right to appeal to the video-refereeing per relay and they are entitled to retain this right should the referee agree with the appeal. 

3 In the case of an appeal for video-refereeing, the referee will walk over to the video consultant, they will watch the video together and after having analysed the action, the referee will give his final decision. 

4 At the finals of the Oympic Games and at the finals of the Senior, Junior and Cadet World Championships, the replays of an action under review must be shown on a screen so as to be visible to the spectators. 

t.62 

1 There shall only be a maximum of 4 repetitions of the action. The referee can choose to review the action in real time or in slow motion, at any speed he wishes .

2 At all weapons and at any time, the referee may consult his monitor before making a decision. 

3 If the fencers’ scores are equal at the end of the match , for the decisive hit, the referee must use the video-refereeing before even giving his decision. 

4 The video consultant may at any time request that the referee use the video-refereeing. 

5 Once the referee, together with the video consultant, has analysed the action, whether it is: 

- at the referee's initiative 

- at the request of the athlete 

- in case of a tied score, before the decisive hit 

- at the video consultant's request 

the decision given by the referee is final and no other review of the same action can be requested. FIE 

21 

November 2023 

6 Each time the referee consults the video, whether on his own initiative, following an appeal or at the suggestion of the video-consultant, the opinions of the referee and the video-consultant must be recorded on the match sheet. 

t.63 

The Referee must use the following signals :FIE

Regulation equipment and checking of equipment by the referee 

t.64 

Before the start of each pool, team match or bout by direct elimination, the Referee must assemble all the competitors and verify that (cf. t.47.2.c): 

1 at all weapons, the FIE guarantee label is present on the fencers’ equipment (clothing, masks). 

2 at foil, the conductive jacket conforms to the provision of Article m.28 when each competitor is in the on guard position; 

3 at épée, the fencer is wearing a jacket conforming to the regulations and that the material from which the clothing is made has not too smooth a surface; 

4 at sabre, the conductive jacket conforms to the provision of Article m.34 when each competitor is in the on guard position. 

5 at all three weapons, each fencer is wearing, under his jacket, a regulation protective under-plastron , made of cloth which can resist 800 Newtons. 

6 at all three weapons, the fencer is not equipped with any electronic communication equipment which would allow a person off the piste to communicate with the fencer during the bout. 

t.65 

1 In pools, this checking must be done at the roll call of the fencers. 

2 For bouts in the direct elimination and the finals this checking must be done in the assembly area. 

t.66 

1 For bouts in the direct elimination and the finals at the World Championships and the Olympic Games , and for finals of World Cup and Grand Prix competitions , the two fencers in each bout will go to the equipment checking zone, located near the piste, 30 minutes before they are due on the piste. Their equipment will be checked under the responsibility of the SEMI (or the designated expert for finals of World Cup competitions). If any anomaly is identified the equipment at fault will be changed at once, without any penalty being applied. The SEMI delegate will hand over the bodywires, the masks and the weapons that have been checked to the Referee for the bout. Ten minutes before they are due on the piste the fencers will report to the Referee designated for their bout. The Referee will hand over a bodywire to each of the fencers in the access zone for the piste. He will check that the fencers are wearing regulation under-jacket protection. 

2 The Referee and the fencers must stay together in the access zone until they go on the piste. 

One minute before they go on the piste the Referee will give a weapon to each fencer, for him to plug in his bodywire. No check will be carried out on the piste prior to the bout. 

t.67 In addition to the checks mentioned above , the Referee of a bout may at any time, on his own initiative or at the request of a fencer or of a team captain, carry out such checks, or verify the checks already carried out or even carry out, or have carried out, new checks (cf. t.47). 

t.68 

1 He will in any case, before each bout, ensure that the guarantee label is present on the clothing, the blade and the mask of each fencer, and that the insulation of the wires inside the guard and the pressure of the spring in the point of foils and épées conforms with the Rules. Checking the insulation of the wires and the pressure of the spring will be repeated each time a weapon is changed. 

2 He makes use of a weight to check the weapon, cf. m.11.3, m.19.3, m.42.2.d. 

3 At épée he will check the total travel and the residual travel of the pointe d’arrêt: FIE 

26 

November 2023 

- the total travel by inserting a gauge measuring 1.5 mm between the barrel of the pointe d’arrêt and the tip. 

- the residual travel by inserting a gauge measuring 0.5 mm between the barrel of the pointe d’arrêt and the tip. The apparatus should not register when the point is depressed. cf. m.19.4.a, b, m.42.e. 

t.69 At the beginning of the bout the Referee will place the reserve equipment that has been checked near the appropriate end of the piste for the fencer concerned. 

Non-regulation equipment 

t.70 

In whatever circumstances a fencer on the piste is found to be in possession of equipment which is non-regulation or defective (according to Material Rules), the referee confiscates the equipment and submits it to the experts on duty for examination. The equipment in question will only be returned to the owner after the measures necessitated by this examination have been completed and, if appropriate, after the payment of any expenses for repairs. The equipment must be rechecked before it is used again. 

t.71 If a fencer appears on the piste: 

- with only one regulation weapon (cf. t.114, 115); or 

- with only one regulation bodywire ; or 

- with only one regulation mask wire ; or 

- with a weapon or a bodywire which does not work or which does not conform with the Rules; or 

- without his protective under-plastron (cf. t.64.5); or 

- with a conductive jacket which does not fully cover the valid target; or 

- with a mask whose 2nd security device is not securely fixed to the body of the mask; or 

- with clothing which does not conform with the Rules; 

the Referee will apply the penalties stipulated in Articles t.158-162, t.165, t.170, for the offences of the 1st group. 

t.72 When during a bout an irregularity is found in the equipment which could be caused by conditions during the bout :

Examples: 

- conductive jacket with holes in which hits are registered as non-valid, 

- weapon or bodywire no longer functioning, 

- pressure of the spring in the point too weak, 

- the travel in the point no longer regulation, 

the Referee will apply neither warning nor penalty and any hit scored with the equipment which has become defective will be awarded. 

However, even during the course of a bout, any fencer whose weapon, at the moment he presents himself on guard and ready to fence, has a curve of the blade which exceeds that permitted (cf . m.8.6, m.16.2, m.23.4) commits an offence in the first group and will be penalised in accordance with Articles t.158-162, t.165, t.170. 

Similarly, even during the course of a bout, any fencer whose mask, at the moment he presents himself on guard and ready to fence, is not securely held on his head by the 2nd security device, commits an offence in the first group and will be penalised in accordance with articles t.158-t.162, t.165, t.170. 

t.73 

1 If, when a fencer appears on the piste or during a bout, it is established that the equipment used by the fencer: 

a) does not bear the marks applied at the preliminary check, the Referee will: FIE 

27 

November 2023 

- annul the last hit, if any, scored by the fencer at fault; 

- penalise him as specified in Articles t.158-162, t.166, t.170, for the offences of the 2nd group. 

b) does not conform to the rules in a way not covered by the preliminary check , the Referee will: 

- penalise him as specified in Articles t.158-162, t.166, t.170, for the offences of the 2nd group .

c) has been passed by the preliminary check but is fraudulent; 

d) bears the marks of the preliminary check which have been imitated or transferred ;

e) has been willfully altered (i.e. in a manner other than by accidental cause or by conditions during the bout) so that it would not pass a preliminary check; 

f) has been altered in any way to allow the recording of hits or the non-functioning of the apparatus at will; 

g) is equipped with electronic communication equipment permitting a person off the piste to communicate with the fencer during the bout; 

then, in cases c), e), f) and g) above , the Referee must immediately confiscate the equipment (weapon, bodywire, if necessary conductive jacket, mask, protective under-plastron, breeches, etc.), and have it examined by the expert on duty. 

2 After having obtained the opinion of the expert (a member of the SEMI Committee at the fencing events at the Olympic Games and at World Championships), who has established the facts (cf. m.33ss), the Referee will apply the following sanctions , without prejudice to the application of Article t.137.2/4; 

- in cases c), e), f) and g) the Referee will penalise him as specified for offences of the 4th group (cf. Articles t.158-162, t.169, t.170). 

3 While awaiting the decision of the Referee that bout will be suspended but the other bouts in the pool may continue. 

t.74 

For all official FIE competitions, every fencer must appear on the piste with clothing conforming to the rules as follows: 

1 Name and nationality, in accordance with the rules, on the back of the jacket. 

2 Wearing his national uniform and logo (cf. m.25.3). 

In case of violation of this rule, the referee will eliminate the fencer at fault from the event in question. 

t.75 

1 If the conductive jacket does not conform to the rules, the fencer must put on a spare jacket that does conform to the rules. If this jacket does not have his name and nationality on the back, the fencer has until the next stage of the competition (from the pools to the table of 64, the table of 32, etc) to get his name and nationality printed on it. 

If this is not done and except in cases of 'force majeure' the referee will eliminate the fencer from the event in question. 

2 If an item of a fencer’s clothing bearing the name and nationality or the national logo becomes dangerous (e.g. tear, burst seam), the fencer must put on spare clothing, which conforms to the rules. If this clothing does not conform to the regulations or does not bear the name and nationality or the national logo, the fencer has until the next stage of the competition to get them printed on it. If this is not done and except in cases of force majeure. The sanctions specified in t.74 apply. FIE

# FOIL 

# THE CONVENTIONS OF FENCING 

METHOD OF MAKING A HIT 

t.76 

1 The foil is a thrusting weapon only. Offensive actions with this weapon are made therefore only with the point. 

2 Pushing or letting drag the point of the electric weapon on the electric piste is forbidden during the actual bout (between ‘Play!’ and ‘Halt!’). Placing the weapon on the piste at any time to straighten it is also forbidden. Any breaking of these rules will be punished according to Articles t.158-162, t.165, t.170, for the offences of the 1st group. 

TARGET 

Limitation of the target 

t.77 

1 The valid target at foil excludes the limbs and the head. It is confined to the trunk, the upper limit being the collar up to 6 cm above the prominences of the collar bones; at the sides to the seams of the sleeves, which should cross the head of the humerus; and the lower limit following a horizontal line across the back joining the tops of the hip bones, thence by straight lines to the junction of the lines of the groin. It also includes the part of the bib beneath a horizontal line 1.5 - 2 cm below the chin which, in any case, may not be lower than the line of the shoulders (see Figure 4). 

2 At foil, only hits which arrive on the valid target are counted. 

Figure 4 Valid target at foil 

> This diagram is for guidance purposes only . In case of any doubt the wording of the appropriate text takes precedence

Hits off the target 

t.78 A hit which is made on a part of the body other than the target (whether directly or as a result of a parry) or which arrives following a fencing fault or after going over the lateral boundary of the piste with both feet, is not counted as a valid hit, but stops the fencing phrase and annuls any subsequent hit. (cf t.79 ). 

Extension of the valid target FIE 

29 

November 2023 

t.79 

1 At foil, it is forbidden to protect the target area or to substitute another part of the body for the target area, by covering it (cf. t.158-162, t.165, t.170); any hit scored by the fencer at fault is annulled. 

a) If, during the fencing phrase, there is protection or substitution of a valid surface, the fencer at fault will be penalised as specified for offences of the 1st group (cf. also t.29). 

b) If, during the fencing phrase, as a result of protection or substitution of a valid surface, a hit correctly given is registered as not valid, the fencer at fault will be penalized as specified for offences of the 1 st group (cf t.158 - 162, t.165, t.170 ) and the hit will be awarded. 

c) However, hits which arrive off the target are counted as valid whenever, by reason of an abnormal position, the fencer has substituted this non-valid target for the valid target. 

2 The referee may question the judges but he alone must decide whether or not the hit is valid. 

ANNULMENT OF A HIT 

t.80 

The Referee must take into account possible failures of the electrical equipment , in particular: 

He must annul a hit which he has just awarded as a result of a hit signalled as on the valid target (coloured lamp) if he establishes, by tests made under his personal supervision, before the bout has effectively recommenced (the command ‘Play!’) and without any of the equipment in use having been changed (cf. t.47.2/d): 

- either that a hit registered as ‘valid’ against the competitor against whom the hit has been awarded can be made without there being in fact a valid hit; 

- or that a ‘non-valid’ hit made by the fencer against whom the hit was awarded is not registered by the apparatus; 

- or that a ‘valid’ hit made by the fencer against whom the hit was awarded does not cause any hit either valid or non-valid to be registered; 

- or that the registration of hits made by the competitor against whom the hit was awarded 

does not remain recorded on the apparatus. 

t.81 

On the other hand, when the Referee has decided that a hit made by a competitor has priority, this hit shall not be annulled if subsequently it is found that a valid hit made by the opponent is registered as non-valid or that the weapon of the fencer against whom the hit was awarded is permanently registering a non-valid hit. 

VALIDITY OR PRIORITY OF THE HIT 

Preface 

t.82 

The Referee alone decides as to the validity or the priority of the hit by applying the following basic rules which are the conventions applicable to foil fencing. 

Respect of the fencing phrase 

t.83 

1 Every attack , that is every initial offensive action, which is correctly executed must be parried or completely avoided and the phrase must be continuous — that is to say, co-ordinated (cf. t.9.1 ). 

2 In order to judge the correctness of an attack the following points must be considered: 

a) The simple attack, direct or indirect (cf. t.10 ), is correctly executed when the straightening of the arm, the point threatening the valid target, precedes the initiation of the lunge or the flèche. FIE 

30 

November 2023 

b) The compound attack (cf. t.10 ) is correctly executed when the arm is straightened in the presentation of the first feint, with the point threatening the valid target, and the arm is not bent during the successive actions of the attack and the initiation of the lunge or the flèche. 

c) The attack with a step-forward-lunge or a step-forward-flèche is correctly executed when the straightening of the arm precedes the end of the step forward and the initiation of the lunge or the flèche. 

d) Actions, simple or compound, steps or feints which are executed with a bent arm , are not considered as attacks but as preparations, laying themselves open to the initiation of the offensive or defensive/offensive action of the opponent (cf . t.10- 11 ). 

t.84 

To judge the priority of an attack when analysing the fencing phrase, it should be noted that: 

1 If the attack is initiated when the opponent is ‘point in line’ (cf. t.15 ), the attacker must, first, deflect the opponent’s blade. Referees must ensure that a mere contact of the blades is not considered as sufficient to deflect the opponent’s blade (cf. t.89.5.a). 

2 If the attacker, when attempting to deflect the opponent’s blade, fails to find it ( dérobement ),the right of attack passes to the opponent. 

3 Continuous steps forward, with the legs crossing one another , constitute a preparation and on this preparation any simple attack has priority. 

t.85 

Attacks by beats on the blade: 

1 In an attack by beating on the blade, the attack is correctly carried out and retains its priority when the beat is made on the foible of the opponent’s blade i.e. the two-thirds of the blade furthest from the guard. 

2 In an attack by beating on the blade, when the beat is made on the forte of the opponent’s blade i.e. the one-third of the blade nearest the guard, the attack is badly executed and the beat gives the opponent the right to an immediate riposte .

t.86 The parry gives the right to riposte: the simple riposte may be direct or indirect, but to annul any subsequent action by the attacker, it must be executed immediately, without indecision or delay. 

t.87 When a compound attack is made, if the opponent finds the blade during one of the feints ,he has the right to riposte. 

t.88 

When compound attacks are made, the opponent has the right to stop-hit ; but to be valid the stop hit must precede the conclusion of the attack by an interval of fencing time; that is to say that the stop hit must arrive before the attacker has begun the final movement of the attack. 

JUDGING OF HITS 

t.89 In applying these basic conventions of foil fencing, the Referee should judge as follows: 

1 When, during a phrase, both fencers are hit simultaneously , there is either a simultaneous action or a double hit .

2 The simultaneous action is due to simultaneous conception and execution of an attack by both fencers; in this case the hits exchanged are annulled for both fencers even if one of them has been hit off the target. 

3 The double hit , on the other hand, is the result of a faulty action on the part of one of the fencers. FIE 

31 

November 2023 

Therefore, when there is not a period of fencing time between the hits: 

4 Only the fencer who is attacked is counted as hit: 

a) If he makes a stop hit on his opponent’s simple attack; 

b) If, instead of parrying, he attempts to dodge the hit and does not succeed in so doing; 

c) If, after making a successful parry, he makes a momentary pause which gives his opponent the right to renew the attack (redoublement, remise or reprise); 

d) If, into a compound attack, he makes a stop hit without being in time; 

e) If, having his ‘point in line ’ (cf. t.15) and being subjected to a beat or a taking of the blade (prise de fer) which deflects his blade, he attacks or places his point in line again instead of parrying a direct thrust made by his opponent. 

5 Only the fencer who attacks is counted as hit: 

a) If he initiates his attack when his opponent has his point in line (cf. t.15) without deflecting the opponent’s weapon. Referees must ensure that a mere contact of the blades is not considered as sufficient to deflect the opponent’s blade. 

b) If he attempts to find the blade, does not succeed (is the object of a dérobement ) and continues the attack. 

c) If, during a compound attack, his opponent finds the blade , but he continues the attack and his opponent ripostes immediately. 

d) If, during a compound attack, he makes a momentary pause , during which time the opponent makes a stop hit, while the attacker continues his attack. 

e) If, during a compound attack, he is stop-hit in time before he begins his final movement. 

f) If he makes a hit by a remise, redoublement or reprise when his original attack has been 

parried and his opponent has made a riposte which is immediate , simple, and executed in one period of fencing time without withdrawing the arm. 

6 The Referee must replace the competitors on guard each time that there is a double hit and he is unable to judge clearly on which side the fault lies. 

# EPEE 

# THE CONVENTIONS OF FENCING 

METHOD OF MAKING A HIT 

t.90 

1 The épée is a thrusting weapon only. Attacks with this weapon are therefore only with the point. 

2 Pushing or letting the point of the electric weapon drag on the electric piste is forbidden during the actual bout (between ‘Play!’ and ‘Halt!’). Placing the weapon on the piste at any time to 

straighten it is also forbidden. 

Any breaking of this rule will be penalised according to Articles t.158-162, t.165, t.170, for the offences of the 1st group. 

THE TARGET FIE 

32 

November 2023 

t.91 At épée the target includes the whole of the fencer’s body including his clothing and equipment. 

Thus any hit which arrives is counted, whatever part of the body (trunk, limbs or head), the clothing or the equipment it touches (see Figure 5). 

Figure 5 Valid target at épée  

> This diagram is for guidance purposes only. In case of any doubt the wording of the appropriate text takes precedence.

JUDGING OF HITS 

t.92 When both competitors are hit, and the apparatus registers both these hits as valid, there is a 

double hit , that is to say a hit is scored against each competitor. 

The annulment of hits 

t.93 In arriving at his judgement, the Referee will disregard hits which are registered as a result of actions: 

- caused by the meeting of the points of the épées or by a hit made on the ground where it is 

not insulated. 

t.94 The Referee must take note of possible failures of the electrical equipment and must annul the last hit registered in the following circumstances: 

1 If a hit made on the guard of the competitor against whom the hit was registered or on the 

conductive piste causes the apparatus to register a hit. 

However, the fact that the épée of a competitor has large or small areas of insulation formed by oxidation, by glue, paint or any other material on any part of the weapon, on which the opponent’s hits can cause a hit to be signalled, or that the electric tip is badly fixed to the end of the blade so that it can be unscrewed or tightened by hand, cannot justify the annulment of hits registered against that competitor. 

2 If a hit properly made by the competitor against whom the hit was registered does not cause the apparatus to register a hit; 

3 If the apparatus fortuitously registers a hit on the side of the competitor against whom the hit was registered, for example, after a beat on the blade, by any movements of his FIE 

33 

November 2023 

opponent, or as a result of any cause other than a properly made hit; 

4 If the registering of a hit made by the competitor against whom the hit was registered is annulled by a subsequent hit made by his opponent. 

5 Special cases 

- If a double hit is registered and one hit is valid and the other is not valid (such as a hit made on some surface other than on the opponent (cf. t.93) or a hit made after leaving the piste (cf. t.33ss), only the valid hit is scored. 

- If a double hit is registered by an established hit and a doubtful hit (failure of the electrical apparatus) the fencer who has made the established hit may choose to accept the double hit or ask to have it annulled. 

t.95 The Referee must also apply the following rules regarding the annulment of hits: 

1 If the incidents mentioned in Article t.94 occur as a result of the competitor’s bodywire being unplugged (either near the hand or at the back of the fencer), they cannot justify the annulment of the hit registered. 

However, if the safety device prescribed by Article m.55.4 is missing or not functioning, the hit should be annulled if the plug at the fencers’ back has become unplugged. 

2 If a competitor tears the conductive piste by a hit made on the ground and, at the same time, the apparatus registers a hit against his opponent, the hit must be annulled. 

# SABRE 

# THE CONVENTIONS OF FENCING 

METHOD OF MAKING A HIT 

t.96 

1 The sabre is a weapon for thrusting and cutting with both the cutting edge and the back of the blade. 

2 All hits made with the cutting edge, the flat or the back of the blade are counted as good (cuts and back cuts). 

3 It is forbidden to hit with the guard . Any hits registered by hitting with the guard must be annulled, the fencer so hitting being penalised as specified in Articles t.158-163, t.165, t.170, for the offences of the 2nd group .

4 Hits through the blade , that is to say those which touch at the same time the valid target and the sabre of the opponent, are valid whenever they arrive clearly on the target. 

5 Placing the weapon on the piste at any time to straighten it is forbidden. Any breaking of this rule will be punished according to Articles t. 158-163, t.165, t.170, for the offences of the 1st group. 

THE TARGET 

t.97 

1 Only hits which arrive on the target are counted as valid. 

The target comprises any part of the body above a horizontal line drawn between the top of the hip bones and then horizontally round the fencer’s trunk (see Figure 6). 

2 At sabre, it is forbidden to protect the target area or to substitute another part of the body for the target area, by covering it (cf. t.158-162, t.165, t.170); any hit scored by the fencer at fault is annulled. FIE 

34 

November 2023 

If, during the fencing phrase, there is protection or substitution of a valid surface, the fencer at fault will be penalised as specified for offences of the 1 st group (cf. also t.29). 

t.98 A hit which arrives on a non-valid part of the target is not counted as a hit; it is not registered by the apparatus, it does not stop the fencing phrase and does not annul any subsequent hits. However, a hit which arrives following a fencing fault or after going over the lateral boundary of the piste with both feet is not counted as a valid hit, but it stops the fencing phrase and therefore annuls any subsequent hit. 

Figure 6 Valid target at sabre 

> This diagram is for guidance purposes only . In case of any doubt the wording of the appropriate text takes precedence.

JUDGING OF HITS 

MATERIALITY AND ANNULMENT OF HITS 

t.99 

1 The Referee must take into account any possible malfunctions in the electrical equipment; in particular he must annul a hit he has just awarded in accordance with a signal from the apparatus if it can be established, by tests carried out under his attentive supervision, before the bout has effectively re-started and with no changes having been made to the equipment (cf. t.47.2.d): 

- that a hit made by the fencer judged to have been hit does not cause the apparatus to register; 

- that a hit made by the fencer judged to have been hit does not remain fixed on the apparatus; 

- that the signal of a hit against the fencer judged to have been hit can be produced either without there having been in fact a valid hit, or by a hit on the weapon or on a non-valid surface. 

2 If the sabre of the fencer judged to have been hit does not conform with Article m.24.6–8 

(insulation of the interior and exterior of the guard, of the handle and of the pommel), there will be no annulment, even if a hit on the weapon causes a signal to register. 

VALIDITY OR PRIORITY OF THE HIT 

Preface 

t.100 

The Referee alone decides as to the validity or the priority of the hit by applying the following basic rules which are the conventions applicable to sabre fencing. FIE 

35 

November 2023 

Respect of the fencing phrase 

t.101 

1 Any attack properly executed (cf. t.9.1 ) must be parried, or completely avoided, and the phrase must be continuous. 

2 The attack is correctly carried out when the straightening of the arm, with the point or the cutting edge continuously threatening the valid target, precedes the initiation of the lunge. 

3 An attack with a lunge is correctly carried out: 

a) in a simple attack (Cf . t.9.1 ) when the beginning of the straightening of the arm precedes the launching of the lunge and the hit arrives at the latest when the front foot hits the piste; 

b) in a compound attack (Cf. t.10 ) when the beginning of the straightening of the arm, on the first feint (Cf. t.103 ), precedes the launching of the lunge and the hit arrives at the latest when the front foot hits the piste. 

4 An attack with a step-forward-lunge is correctly carried out: 

a) in a simple attack (Cf. t.9.1 ) when the beginning of the straightening of the arm precedes the step-forward and when the hit arrives at the latest when the front foot hits the piste ;

b) in a compound attack (Cf. t.10 ) when the beginning of the straightening of the arm for the first feint (Cf. t.103) precedes the step-forward, followed by the lunge, and the hit arrives at the latest when the front foot hits the piste. 

5 The fleche and any forward movement in which the rear foot completely passes the front foot is forbidden . Any offence will be penalised as specified for penalties in the 1 st group (cf. t.158- 162, t.165, t.170 ). Any hit scored by the fencer at fault will be annulled. However, any hit correctly executed by his opponent is valid. 

t.102 In order to judge as to the correctness of an attack the following points must be considered: 

1 If the attack is initiated when the opponent has his point ‘in line’ (cf. t.15) the attacker must first deflect his opponent’s weapon. Referees must ensure that a mere contact of the blades is not considered as sufficient to deflect the opponent’s blade. 

2 If, when attempting to find the opponent’s blade to deflect it, the blade is not found (dérobement ), the right of attack passes to the opponent. 

3 If the attack is commenced when the opponent’s blade is not ‘in line’ , the attack may be completed either direct, or by a disengagement or by a cutover, or else be preceded by feints (cf. t.103 ) which oblige the opponent to parry. 

t.103 

1 In compound attacks the feint must be correctly carried out, i.e.: 

a) A feint with the point , with the arm straightened and the point threatening the target continuously. 

b) A feint with a cut, the arm straightened, the blade and the arm forming an obtuse angle of about 135°, with the cutting edge threatening a valid part of the target. 

1 If during a compound attack the opponent finds the blade during one of the feints , he has the right to riposte. 

2 In a compound attack the opponent has the right to stop-hit; but, in order to be valid, the stop hit must precede the last movement of the attack by one period of fencing time, i.e. the stop hit must arrive before the attacker has started the last movement of the attack itself. 

t.104 Attacks by beats on the blade 

1 In an attack by beating on the blade, the attack is correctly carried out and retains its priority when the beat is made on the foible of the opponent’s blade , i.e. the two-thirds of FIE 

36 

November 2023 

the blade furthest from the guard. 

2 In an attack by beating on the blade, when the beat is made on the forte of the opponent’s blade , i.e. the one-third of the blade nearest the guard, the attack is badly executed and the beat gives the opponent the right to an immediate riposte. 

t.105 

1 The parry gives the right to riposte ; a simple riposte may be direct or indirect, but in order to annul any subsequent movement by the attacker, it must be carried out immediately, without any hesitation or pause. 

2 Against cuts with the cutting edge, the flat or the back of the blade , the object of the parry is to prevent hits made by the opponent arriving on the valid target; therefore: 

a) The parry is properly carried out when, before the completion of the attack, it prevents the arrival of that attack by closing the line in which that attack is to finish. 

b) When a parry is properly executed, the attack by the opponent must be declared parried, and judged as such by the Referee, even if, as a result of its flexibility , the tip of the opponent’s weapon makes contact with the target. 

Judging of hits 

t.106 

In applying these basic conventions of sabre fencing, the Referee should judge as follows: 

1 When during a phrase both fencers are hit simultaneously there is either a simultaneous action or a double hit :

The simultaneous action is due to simultaneous conception and execution of an attack by both fencers; in this case the hits exchanged are annulled for both fencers. 

2 The double hit (coup double) on the other hand, is the result of a clearly faulty action on the part of one of the fencers. 

Therefore, when there is not an interval of fencing time between the hits: 

3 The fencer who is attacked is alone counted as hit: 

a) If he makes a stop hit on his opponent’s simple attack; 

b) If, instead of parrying, he attempts to avoid the hit and does not succeed in so doing; 

c) If, after making a successful parry, he makes a momentary pause (delayed riposte) which gives his opponent the right to renew the attack (redoublement, or remise or reprise); 

d) If, during a compound attack, he makes a stop hit without being in time; 

e) If, having his point ‘in line’ (cf. t.15) and being subjected to a beat or a taking of the blade (prise de fer) which deflects his blade, he attacks or places his point in line again instead of parrying a direct hit made by his opponent. 

4 The fencer who attacks is alone counted as hit: 

a) If he initiated his attack when his opponent had his point ‘in line’ (cf. t.15 ), without deflecting the opponent’s weapon. Referees must ensure that a mere contact of the blades is not considered as sufficient to deflect the opponent’s blade. 

b) If he attempts to find the blade, does not succeed (because of a derobement ) and continues the attack. 

c) If, during a compound attack, he allows his opponent to find the blade , and continues the attack while his opponent ripostes immediately. 

d) If, during a compound attack, he bends his arm or makes a momentary pause , during which time the opponent makes a stop hit or an attack while the attacker continues his own attack. FIE 

37 

November 2023 

e) If, during a compound attack, he is stop-hit one period of fencing time (temps d’escrime) before he makes his final movement. 

f) If he makes a hit by a remise, redoublement or reprise following a parry by his opponent 

which has been followed by a riposte which is immediate, simple and executed in one period of fencing time without withdrawing the arm. 

5 When there is a double hit, and if the Referee is unable clearly to judge from which side the fault has come, he must replace the competitors on guard .

# DISCIPLINARY RULES FOR COMPETITIONS 

## Chapter 1 

## APPLICATION 

Persons subject to these rules 

t.107 

1 The regulations laid down in this part apply to all persons who take part in or attend a 

fencing competition , including the spectators. (cf. t.109, t.110, t.133) 

2 In the following articles, all these persons are referred to as fencers .

Order and discipline 

t.108 

1 Fencers must observe strictly and faithfully the Rules and the Statutes of the FIE, the particular rules for the competition in which they are engaged, the traditional customs of courtesy and integrity and the instructions of the officials. 

2 In particular they will subscribe, in an orderly, disciplined and sporting manner , to the following provisions; all breaches of these rules may entail punishments by the competent disciplinary authorities after, or even without, prior warning, according to the facts and circumstances (cf. t.158–t.170). 

t.109 

Everybody taking part in or present at a fencing competition must respect the FIE statutes and rules, including but not limited to the FIE Ethical Code and Safeguarding Policy. They must remain orderly and must not disturb the smooth running of the competition . During bouts no one is allowed to go near the pistes , to give advice to the fencers , to criticise the Referee or the judges, to insult them or to attempt to influence them in any way. Even the 

team captain must remain in the space assigned to him and he may only intervene in the situations and in the manner provided for in Article t.130 of the Rules. The Referee must stop immediately any activity which disturbs the smooth running of the bout which he is refereeing (cf. t.137.1–3). Any person who, for any reason, threatens or insults an official commits an offence of the 4th group and is penalised according to article t.169. 

Any person present who witnesses a breach of the FIE Ethical Code or the Safeguarding Policy must report this to the Safeguarding Officer if present, or to the Supervisor or to the Directoire Technique. 

t.110 Smoking in competition halls is forbidden. Smoking will be considered as a disturbance of the smooth running of the competition (cf. t .111 ). 

Any breach of these rules will be punished as laid down in Articles t.158-162, t.167, t.168, t.170, for the offences of the 3rd group. FIE 

38 

November 2023 

t.111 The Referee and/or the Directoire Technique, on their own authority or at the request of an official delegate of the FIE or of the Organising Committee, can decide to expel from the competition venue, with or without a warning, any person who by his/her gestures, attitude , or language or by breaching the FIE Safeguarding Policy disturbs the good order or smooth running of the event. 

The competitors 

Pledge of honour 

t.112 By the mere fact of entering a fencing competition, the fencers pledge their honour to observe the Rules and the decisions of the officials, to be respectful towards the referees and judges and scrupulously to obey the orders and injunctions of the Referee (cf.t. 158-163, t.169, t.170 ). 

Refusing to fence an opponent 

t.113 

1 No fencer (individual or team) from an FIE member national federation may take part in an official competition if he refuses to fence against any other fencer whatsoever (individual or team) correctly entered in the event. Should this rule be broken, the penalties specified for offences of the 4 th group will be applied (cf. t.158-162, t.169, t.170). 

2 The FIE shall consider whether there are grounds, and to what extent, for taking sanctions against the national federation to which the disqualified competitor belongs (cf. FIE Statutes 1.2.4 and Rules Article t.170 ).

Presence on time 

t.114 The fencers, completely equipped, with all equipment conforming with the regulations (cf. 

t.64– t.70 ) and ready to fence, must be present at the time and place appointed for the beginning of the pool, match, or bout of direct elimination, or at the time appointed for the checking of their equipment before their bout (cf. t.64-66), as well as during the competition, whenever the Referee requires it. 

t.115 

1 When presenting themselves to fence a bout, the fencers must arrive on the piste 

completely ready to fence — regulation clothing, jacket fastened, sword-hand gloved and holding the weapon, body wire connected to the plug inside the guard. The mask should be carried in the unarmed hand. 

2 Before the start of the bout, the fencers' hair must be fastened and placed inside the clothing and/or mask in such a way as to ensure that: 

- it does not cover a valid surface (and thus prevent a hit from being scored). 

- it does not conceal the name and nationality of the fencer. 

- it does not need to be put back in place during the bout, thus interrupting it. 

In the case of violation of this rule, the referee will apply the penalties for group 1 offences (t.158- 162, t.165, t.170 ). 

t.116 Under no circumstances should the fencers dress or undress in public except in the case of an accident duly recognised by the doctor on duty or by the representative of the Medical Commission (cf. t.126, t.158-162, t.165, t.170 .). Any infringement will be sanctioned for the offences of the 1st group. 

t.117 

The fencers must arrive on the piste, to fence their bouts, with two weapons (one as a spare), 

two bodywires (one as a spare) and two mask wires (one as a spare) which satisfy the regulations and are in perfect working order (cf. t.71, t.158-162, t.165, t.170). 

t.118 

Before the start of the pool, the team match or the bouts of direct elimination FIE 

39 

November 2023 

(individual or team): 

1 When a fencer or complete team do not present themselves to the Referee at his first call ,ten minutes before the time indicated to come onto the piste for the start of the pool or team match, or the start of the bouts of direct elimination (cf. Article t.66.1 ), the fencer or team concerned will be eliminated .

2 A team is considered complete when at least three fencers are present. 

3 Only those members of the team (the fencers, the team captain and one trainer — cf. Article 

t.132.1 ) who are present at the Referee’s first call , ten minutes before the time indicated for the start of the match, may take part in a team match. 

During a competition, individual or team: 

t.119 During a competition, individual or team , if a fencer does not present himself on the piste, ready to fence, when ordered to do so by the Referee: 

a. The fencer or team member not present will be penalised with a Yellow Card; 

b. A second call will be made, one minute after the first call, followed by a Red Card for the fencer or team member not present; 

c. A third and last call will be made, one minute after the second call, followed by elimination from the competition for the fencer not present in an individual competition or for the whole team in a team competition. 

t.120 

Should a fencer abandon a bout by leaving the piste (cf. t.23.6 ), he will be penalised as specified in Articles t.158-162, t.165, t.170, for the offences of the 1st group .

Fencing etiquette 

t.121 

1 The competitors must fence faithfully and strictly according to the rules laid down in these Rules. All breaches of these rules will incur the penalties laid down hereinafter (cf t.158-162, t.170 .). 

2 All bouts must preserve the character of a courteous and frank encounter. All irregular actions (fleche attack which finishes with a collision jostling the opponent, disorderly fencing, irregular movements on the piste, hits achieved with violence, blows struck with the guard, an intentional fall down to avoid the touch) or anti-sporting behaviour are strictly forbidden (cf. t.158-162, t.170). Should such an offence occur, any hit scored by the fencer at fault is annulled. 

t.122 

Before the beginning and at the end of a bout, the two fencers must perform the fencer's salute to their opponent, to the referee and to the spectators, as defined in article t.1. 

When the final hit of the bout has been scored, the two fencers stand still on their on-guard line while the referee is making his/her decision. 

The two fencers then perform the fencer's salute (cf. t.1) to their opponent, to the referee and to the spectators.The bout has then ended. 

If either or both of the two fencers refuse to comply with these rules, the Referee will penalise him/them as specified for offences of the 4 th group (cf. t.158-162, t.169, t.170). 

Application: until the end of the 2024-2025 season 

t.123 

During or after a bout , even if the fencer has already left the piste, any act against the spirit of sportsmanship such as violently or dangerously throwing one’s mask or any other piece of equipment will be penalised as specified in article t.169 (c.f. t.108.1, 2 and t.109), for the offences of the 4th group .FIE 

40 

November 2023 

Unwillingness to fight (Non-combativity) 

t.124 

There is unwillingness to fight when there is one minute of fencing without a hit or without a hit scored off the target. 

In the event of unwillingness to fight , the Referee will immediately call ‘Halt!’ as a decision of "fact" (cf.t.136.2). 

Unwillingness to fight is sanctioned as follows (t.170): 

1 Individual events – Direct elimination

3 In both individual and team competitions 

a) The P-yellow (warning), P-red (penalty hit) and P-black (the possible losing of a bout or match) cards received during any one bout or match (during all 9 relays) are valid only for that bout or match. They are not transferable to the following bout or match. 

No P-card (yellow, red or black) may be awarded in individual competitions at 14-14 or in team matches at 44-44. 

b) In both individual and team competitions, fencers and teams who have lost the bout/match following the award of a P-Black card, will be ranked in the final results of the competition as having lost the bout/match. They receive the corresponding points. 

c) In both individual and team competitions, the period/relay continues after the awarding of a P-Yellow or a P-Red card. 

d) The minute starts again after each hit, each hit off the target, each hit annulled, each penalty hit and at the beginning of each period or relay. 

e) The referee must record these P-yellow, P-red and P-black cards separately on the score sheet. The sanctions awarded for unwillingness to fight are not cumulative with any other sanction awarded. 

f) In both individual and team competitions, if, at the end of the regulation time, there is equality of scores, article t.124 does not apply and articles t.40.3 and t.41.5 will apply. 

t.125 The fencer, whether on or off the piste, must keep his mask on until the Referee calls ‘Halt!’ He may under no circumstances address the Referee until the Referee has made his decision (cf . t.158- 162, t.165, t.170 ). Any infringement will be sanctioned for the offences of the 1st group .

t.126 

………………… 

t.127 At the end of a bout, the Referee must bring together the two fencers, to announce clearly the score , which will be transmitted to the Directoire Technique. He must say clearly: ‘Mister X won against Mister Y with the following score…’ 

Personal effort 

t.128 Competitors must fence to their utmost ability in a sportsmanlike manner until the end of the competition in order to obtain the best possible classification, without giving away hits or seeking to be favoured by being given hits by anyone (cf. t.158-162, t.169, t.170 ). Any infringement will be sanctioned for the offences of the 4th group. 

The team manager 

t.129 In all competitions, all competitors of the same nationality must be under the direction of a 

team manager (who may or may not fence), who is responsible to the Directoire Technique or the Organising Committee for the discipline, conduct, and sportsmanship of the members of his team. 

The team captain 

t.130 In team events, only the team captain has the right to be to approach the Referee and/or the refereeing delegates in order to decide with them any technical matters or to register protests. FIE 

42 

November 2023 

The procedure for claims is set out in articles t.172-175. 

The members of the team who have scrupulously abided by his decisions may not be held responsible by the relevant authorities. However, they are personally responsible for any actions they commit for which their team captain has not taken authority and for any offence committed by them in violation of the present Rules. 

The instructors, trainers and technicians 

t.131 

1 During the direct elimination of the individual events, the fencer’s coach, medical staff and technicians are not allowed to remain near their fencers; the coaches are allowed to be inside the competition area in a place indicated by the organisers. 

2 The Referee may, whenever he considers it necessary, authorise a person to come briefly to the assistance of a fencer. 

3 Each nation which has a fencer taking part in the round of the competition in progress may designate a maximum of two people who have the right to be positioned near the Piste Enclosure, outside it but close to a point of access. The organisers must provide the necessary space for these people. 

t.132 In team competitions, there must be enclosures reserved for the team members. 

Only the team captain and one coach have the right to be with the team fencers inside the Team Enclosures , which must be clearly marked out. 

1 During team matches, the team members not actually fencing must remain within their Team Enclosure. 

2 During team competitions, no one has the right to enter the Piste Enclosure without the Referee’s permission. In the case of such an offence, the Referee will penalise the offending team as provided for in Articles t.158-162, t.165, t.170 . A warning imposed on a team is valid for the complete team match. Should a fencer, within the same match, commit another offence from the First Group, the Referee will penalise him on each occasion with a Red Card. 

The spectators 

t.133 Spectators are obliged not to interfere with the good order of a competition, to do nothing which may tend to influence the fencers or the Referee, and to respect the decisions of the latter even when they do not agree with them. They must obey any instructions which the Referee may deem it necessary to give them (cf . t.109-110, t.167-168, t.170 , penalties for the offences of the 3rd group). 

## Chapter 2 

## THE DISCIPLINARY AUTHORITIES AND THEIR COMPETENCE 

Preamble 

t.134 The following articles only regulate discipline at competition venues. Depending on the gravity of the offences established, they do not exclude the application of the Disciplinary Code of the FIE (Chapter VII of the Statutes of the FIE) which completes or, if the case arises, takes priority over the following articles. 

Jurisdictional bodies 

t.135 The following are the competent disciplinary authorities: 

- the Referee (cf . t.137 ); 

- the Refereeing Commission delegate(s); FIE 

43 

November 2023 

- the Directoire Technique (cf. t.139, o.15 to o.22 ); 

- the Supervisor; 

- the Executive Committee of the IOC at the Olympic Games (cf .t.142 ); 

- the Bureau of the FIE (cf. t.143.1/4, o.12 ); 

- the Executive Committee of the FIE (cf . t.143.5 ); 

- the Disciplinary Commission of the FIE and its Tribunal; 

- the Court of Arbitration for Sport and the Sports Arbitration Tribunal. 

See also Disciplinary Rules of the FIE (Chapter VII of the FIE Statutes). 

Principle of jurisdiction 

t.136 

1 Whatever juridical authority has taken a decision, this decision may be subject to an appeal to a higher juridical authority, but only to one such appeal. 

2 No decision on a question of fact can be the subject of an appeal (cf . t.172 ). 

3 An appeal against a decision only suspends that decision when it can be judged immediately. 

The Referee 

t.137 

1 The Referee is responsible not only for the direction of the bout, the judging of hits and the checking of equipment, but equally for the maintenance of order in the bouts which he is refereeing (cf. t.47.2.i). 

2 In his capacity as director of the bout and arbiter of hits, he can, in accordance with the rules, 

penalise the competitors, either by refusing to award a hit which they have in fact made on the opponent, or by awarding against them a hit which they have not in fact received, or by excluding them from the competition which he is refereeing, all, according to the circumstances, with or without prior warning. In these circumstances, and if he has judged on a matter of fact , his decisions are irrevocable (cf. t.172 ). 

3 By reason of the right of jurisdiction which he has over all the fencers who participate in, or are present at a competition which he is refereeing, he can also propose to the Directoire Technique the expulsion from the venue of the competition of the spectators, trainers, instructors and other persons who accompany the competitors (cf. t.158-162, t.167, t.168, t.170). 

4 Finally, he may recommend to the Directoire Technique all other penalties which he considers appropriate (exclusion from the whole competition, suspension or disqualification) (cf. t.139.3 ). 

t.138 

The Refereeing Commission delegate or the Supervisor (if there is no delegate) is the authority competent to deal with appeals against the decisions of the Referee. 

The Directoire Technique at official FIE competitions (cf. o.15 – o.22) 

t.139 

1 The Directoire Technique, the refereeing delegates or the supervisor have jurisdiction over all the fencers who take part in or are present at a competition which they are running. 

2 When necessary they can intervene on their own initiative in all disputes. 

3 They are also responsible for maintaining order and discipline during competitions, and may use the penalties specified in the Rules. 

4 The Directoire Technique is responsible for sending direct to the Central Office of the FIE 

announcements of disciplinary penalties pronounced during the competitions, as well as any requests for censure, suspension, extension of penalty or permanent suspension, and requests for ultimate appeals. FIE 

44 

November 2023 

5 The Directoire Technique activates any penalty imposed against which no appeal is possible or which is not subject to suspension ( cf. t.136 ). 

t.140 

The disciplinary decisions of the Directoire Technique, the refereeing delegates or the supervisor that they take spontaneously or in their own right (as the first level of authority) are subject to appeal to the Disciplinary Commission of the FIE. 

t.141 

All the decisions of the Directoire Technique, the refereeing delegates or the supervisor are 

immediately enforceable . No appeal against a decision can suspend that decision during the competition. 

The Executive Committee of the IOC at the Olympic Games 

t.142 The Executive Committee of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) is the final arbiter for all disputes of a non-technical nature which may arise during the Olympic Games. It may intervene either on its own responsibility, or at the request of a National Olympic Committee, the FIE or the Organising Committee. 

FIE Central Office, Disciplinary Commission, Executive Committee, Sports Arbitration Tribunal 

t.143 

1 All disciplinary matters referred to the FIE by a national federation, a Directoire Technique or any other competent body on the occasion of an official FIE competition are addressed to the Central Office of the FIE . This latter transmits them to the competent body. 

2 The Disciplinary Commission of the FIE is the juridical body of the FIE that, within the limits of the territories over which the FIE has authority, settles all disciplinary matters referred to the FIE and judges all appeals against decisions taken by a Directoire Technique, the Refereeing Commission delegate or the Supervisor (if there is no delegate). 

3 The Sports Arbitration Tribunal (TAS) judges all appeals against the decisions of the tribunals of the Disciplinary Commission. 

4 In urgent cases, t he FIE Bureau may take the prelimin ary administrative measures necessary for the suspension of the licence of the accused in accordance with the Disciplinary Code. 

5 The Executive Committee ensures that the decisions of the Disciplinary Commission are respected and carried out. 

See the Disciplinary Code of the FIE (Chapter VII of the FIE Statutes). 

## Chapter 3 

## PENALTIES 

Classification of penalties 

t.144 There are distinct categories of penalty applicable to different sorts of offence (cf. t.158ss). 

1 Penalties related to fencing , applicable to offences committed while fencing. These are: FIE 

45 

November 2023 

- the loss of ground on the piste 

- refusal to award a hit actually made 

- awarding a hit which has not in fact been received 

- exclusion from the competition 

2 Disciplinary penalties applicable to offences concerned with maintenance of order, discipline or sportsmanship. These are: 

- awarding a hit which has not in fact been received 

- exclusion from the competition 

- exclusion from participation in the whole tournament 

- expulsion from the venue of the competition 

- disqualification 

- censure 

- fine 

- temporary suspension 

- permanent suspension 

t.145 

1 All these penalties except permanent suspension can be applied by the competent authorities at a competition — the Referee and the Directoire Technique. 

2 Temporary suspension can be applied by these authorities only in the case of a fencer refusing to salute (cf. t.122 , t.170). 

See the Disciplinary Code of the FIE (Chapter VII of the FIE Statutes). 

Penalties related to fencing 

t.146 

…………………… 

Refusal to award a hit actually made 

t.147 

Although a competitor may in fact have hit his opponent on the target, this hit may be disallowed , either because it did not arrive during the period of time during which fencing is allowed, or because the competitor had crossed the boundaries of the piste, or because of defects in the electrical equipment, or because violence was involved in the making of the hit, or because of other reasons as laid down in the Rules (according to the Technical Rules). 

Award of a hit which has not in fact been received 

t.148 A competitor may have a hit awarded against him which he has not in fact received, either because he has crossed the rear limit of the piste (cf. t.34 ), or because he has committed an offence which has prevented his opponent fencing (a flèche attack which jostles the opponent, the use of the unarmed hand while fencing, etc.) according to the Technical Rules. 

Exclusion 

t.149 

1 A competitor who, while fencing, commits certain violent or vindictive actions against his opponent, or who does not fence to his utmost ability , or who profits from a fraudulent agreemen t with his opponent, may be excluded from the competition. 

2 A competitor who is excluded from a competition may not continue to take part in that competition, even if he is already qualified for promotion to the next round. He loses the right to his individual classification and all the fencers ranked after the disqualified fencer move up one place in the results of the competition. If necessary the two third places are decided according to their ranking for the composition of the table. Under all circumstances, only fencers who have actually received points in the competition can move up a place in the competition’s results. 

DISCIPLINARY PENALTIES FIE 

46 

November 2023 

Exclusion from the competition 

t.150 

1 Exclusion from a competition may also be imposed for a disciplinary offence (failure to appear on the piste as required, weapons not in accordance with the rules, reprehensible attitude towards an official, etc.). 

2 The consequences of such exclusion for the competitor are the same as those described in Article t.149 above. 

Expulsion from the venue of the competition or the tournament 

t.151 

1 A competitor who is excluded from a tournament will no longer be allowed to participate in any competition during that tournament, either at the same weapon or another. 

2 When this penalty is imposed on a team , the position of each member of that team must be examined individually, and the members of that team may, according to the circumstances, have different penalties imposed on them (cf. t.130). 

t.152 

All participants or non-competitors who participate in or are present at a competition (instructors, trainers, technicians, supporters, officials, spectators) may be expelled . Such expulsion has the effect of forbidding them access to the venue for the duration of the competition or tournament (cf. t.133, t.137.3, t.170 ). In no circumstances can the imposition of this penalty give cause for redress to anyone. 

Disqualification 

t.153 

1 Disqualification of a competitor does not necessarily incur his (temporary) suspension or permanent suspension, if he has acted in good faith; a request for supplementary penalties for fraudulent intention may, however, be made against the competitor. 

2 A team which has included a competitor who is disqualified necessarily incurs the penalty of that member and is also disqualified. 

3 The consequences of disqualification are the same as those for exclusion from the competition (see Article t.149). 

Censure 

t.154 In cases where a more severe disciplinary sanction is not justified, the fencer or the official may be sanctioned by censure .

Temporary suspension 

t.155 

1 A competitor who is suspended cannot take part in any official FIE competition during the time he is suspended. 

2 All other persons who are suspended are debarred from exercising their functions within the limits of time and place fixed when the suspension is imposed. 

Permanent suspension 

t.156 Permanent suspension involves the same consequences as suspension, but is permanent. 

ANNOUNCEMENT OF PENALTIES 

t.157 

1 The Directoire Technique is required to inform the Central Office of the FIE without delay of 

penalties applied during the competition and their reasons (cf. t.139.4 ). 

2 At the Olympic Games , the Directoire Technique must advise the IOC via the Organising Committee. FIE

November 2023 

## Chapter 4 

## THE PENALTIES AND THE COMPETENT JURIDICAL AUTHORITIES 

The types (groups) of penalty 

t.158 There are three types of penalty to be applied in the cases indicated in the table in Article t.170. If a referee has to penalise a fencer who has committed several faults at the same time, he should penalise the least serious fault first. 

t.159 

Penalties are cumulative and they are valid for the bout with the exception of those indicated by a BLACK CARD , which means exclusion from the competition, suspension for the remainder of the tournament and for the following 60 days of the active season (1 September – World Championships for the Juniors, and 1 September – World Championships for the Seniors), whether current or forthcoming, or both (cf.t.169.2). 

t.160 However, a team excluded from a tournament because of a black card imposed on one of its members during a team match, is not penalized by suspension. Only the individual fencer who was penalised will be suspended in accordance with t.159 and cannot be selected as a member of any team during the period of suspension. Cf. o.99.8. 

t.161 

Certain offences can result in the annulment of the hit scored by the fencer at fault. During the bout, only hits scored in circumstances connected with the offence may be annulled (cf .t.170 ). 

t.162 The penalties are as follows: 

1 a warning , indicated by a YELLOW CARD with which the Referee identifies the fencer at fault. The fencer then knows that any further offence on his part will result in a penalty hit. 

2 a penalty hit , indicated by a RED CARD with which the Referee identifies the fencer at fault. A hit is added to the score of his opponent and may, if the last hit is at stake, lead to the loss of the bout. Furthermore, a RED CARD can only be followed by another RED CARD or by a 

BLACK CARD , depending on the nature of the second offence (cf . t.170 ). 

3 Exclusion from the competition, suspension from the remainder of the tournament and for the following 60 days of the active season, whether current or forthcoming, indicated by a BLACK CARD with which the Referee identifies the person at fault. 

4 Expulsion from the competition venue (any person disturbing the order of the competition). 

t.163 All warnings ( YELLOW CARDS ), penalty hits ( RED CARDS ) and exclusions ( BLACK CARDS ) must be noted on the score-sheet of the bout, the pool or the match, together with the group to which they belong. 

Competence 

t.164 The offences and their penalties which appear in different articles of the Rules are summarised in the table that follows in Article t.170 ; they are divided into four groups (cf. 

t.165–t.169 ). All these penalties are within the competence of the Referee , although the Directoire Technique still retains the right to intervene on its own initiative (cf. t.139.1–3 ). 

The First Group of offences 

t.165 FIE 

48 

November 2023 

The first infringement in this First Group is penalised by a YELLOW CARD (warning). If during the same bout the fencer commits the same or a different offence in this group the Referee penalises him on each occasion, with a RED CARD (penalty hit). If the fencer at fault has already been penalised by a RED CARD because of an offence listed in the Second or Third Group, he receives a further RED CARD for his first infringement relating to the First Group. 

The Second Group of offences 

t.166 

Every offence in the Second Group, including the first infringement, is penalised by a RED CARD (penalty hit). 

The Third Group of offences 

t.167 

1 The first infringement in the Third Group is penalised by a RED CARD (penalty hit), even if the fencer at fault has already received a RED CARD as a result of offences in the First or Second Groups. 

2 If during the same bout the fencer commits the same or a different offence in this group, he is penalised with a BLACK CARD (exclusion from the competition, suspension from the remainder of the tournament and for the following 60 days of the active season (1 September – World Championships for the Juniors, and 1 September – World Championships for the Seniors), whether current or forthcoming). 

t.168 

Any person not on the piste who disturbs the good order of the competition receives: 

1 On the first infringement , a warning, indicated by a YELLOW CARD , valid for the whole of the competition, which must be noted on the bout score-sheet and recorded by the Directoire Technique; 

2 At the second infringement during the same competition a BLACK CARD .

3 In the most serious cases concerning disturbance either on or off the piste, the Referee may exclude or expel the person at fault immediately .

The Fourth Group of Offences 

t.169 

1 The first infringement in the Fourth Group, is penalised by a BLACK CARD (exclusion from the competition, suspension from the remainder of the tournament and for the following 60 days of the active season (1 September – World Championships for the Juniors, and 1 September – World Championships for the Seniors), whether current or forthcoming or both). 

2 Furthermore any black card awarded at a competition of the FIE or at a competition organized by any Confederation which has subscribed to the FIE disciplinary code shall be reported within 10 days to the President of the FIE, for him to assess whether the severity of the offence committed warrants the sending of the report made by the FIE supervisor or by the Directoire Technique to the president of the Legal Commission, requesting him to establish a Disciplinary Tribunal to determine if penalties in addition to those imposed at the competition should be imposed.

The various penalties are imposed by the competent authorities who will reach their decisions in an equitable manner, and will take into account the gravity of the offence and the circumstances in which it was committed (cf. t.135ss, t.158-162, t.176-178 ). 

Protests and appeals 

Against a decision of the Referee 

t.172 

1 No appeal can be made against the decision of the Referee regarding a point of fact, except as permitted in o.105 and t.60-t.63 for video refereeing (cf. t.136.1/2, t.137.2). 

2 If a fencer infringes this principle, casting doubt on the decision of the Referee on a point of fact during the bout, he will be penalised according to the rules (cf. t.158-162, t.165, t.170 ), for the offences of the 1st group. But if the Referee is ignorant of or misunderstands a definite rule or applies it in a manner contrary to the Rules, an appeal on this matter may be entertained. A point of fact includes, but is not limited to, any ruling by the referee analysing what happened on the piste, such as the validity or priority of a hit, whether a fencer left the side or end of the piste or if a person’s behaviour is a Group 3 or Group 4 offence. 

t.173 

This appeal must be made: 

1 in individual events, by the fencer, 

2 in team events, by the fencer or the team captain, it should be made courteously but without formality, and should be made verbally to the Referee immediately and before any decision is made regarding a subsequent hit. 

t.174 

If the Referee maintains his opinion, the Refereeing Commission delegate or the Supervisor (if there is no delegate) has the authority to settle an appeal (cf. t.141). If such an appeal is deemed to be unjustified , the fencer will be penalised in accordance with Articles t.158-162, t.165, t.170 .

Other protests and appeals 

t.175 

Complaints and protests which are not concerned with a referee’s decision must be made in writing without delay ; they must be addressed to the Directoire Technique. 

t.176 

If a complaint or protest contests a decision initially taken by the Directoire Technique or an official FIE delegate it should be addressed to the FIE Bureau in accordance with Articles 7.2 of the Statutes and t.140. 

Method of decision 

t.177 

The decisions of the Directoire Technique are by majority vote , the chairman (president) having the casting vote in case of a tie. FIE

Repetition of offence 

t.178 

1 For offences regarding sportsmanship, good order or discipline, a fencer is said to repeat 

an offence if he commits a new offence, other than violation of the rules governing bouts, within two years of being censured, or subjected to exclusion, disqualification or suspension. 

2 For the repetition of an offence, the penalty which must be imposed is: 

a) Exclusion from the competition , if the previous penalty was a censure. 

b) Disqualification from participation in the whole tournament , if the previous penalty was exclusion or disqualification from a competition.
