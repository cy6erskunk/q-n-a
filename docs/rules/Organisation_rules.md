# PART C: PROCEDURES DURING THE COMPETITIONS 

# Chapter 1 

# FORMULAE 

# INDIVIDUAL COMPETITIONS 

### o.66

Individual competitions may be organised: 

a) By direct elimination with a mixed system consisting of one round of eliminating pools and a 

preliminary direct elimination table, followed by a main direct elimination table of 64 fencers to qualify 8 or 4 fencers for a direct elimination final. 

b) By direct elimination with a mixed system consisting of one round of eliminating pools, 

followed by a direct elimination table to qualify 8 or 4 fencers for a direct elimination final. 

c) By direct elimination throughout . (This tableau, applicable at the Olympic Games, is contained 

as an annexe.) 

## A. GENERAL RULES FOR THE ROUND OF POOLS 

### o.67

1 In all competitions for which the formula includes a round of pools , these pools consist of 7

fencers if the number of participants is divisible by 7. Otherwise the pools are of 7 and 6. In no case may the pools be of fewer than 6 fencers. 

If, however, as the result of the absence of one or more fencers, one or more pools were to be reduced to 5 or fewer fencers, the Directoire Technique must add to these pools one or more fencers from other pools of 7 fencers in the same round of pools, taking into account the initial ranking of the fencer(s) being replaced. 

Depending on the number of participants, the pool round may take place over several rounds. 

The Directoire Technique must then provide for each pool round, pools of 7 and 6 (if applicable) in order to balance one or more pools in the event of fencers absent at roll call in pools of 6. 

2 At World Cup and Grand Prix competitions the organising country may add the necessary 

number of fencers of their own nationality for all the pools to consist of 7 fencers. 

Composition of pools 

### o.68

1. The pools are composed taking account of the initial seeding in the competition, which is based on the latest official FIE ranking and by drawing lots among any fencers who are not in the ranking. The pools are composed using the following method:

   | Pool A | Pool B | Pool C |
   |--------|--------|--------|
   | 1      | 2      | 3      |
   | 6      | 5      | 4      |
   | 7      | 8      | 9      |
   | 12     | 11     | 10     |
   | 13     | 14     | 15     |
   | 18     | 17     | 16     |
   | 19     | 20     | 21     |

2. The allocation of fencers in the pools must be made in such a way as to place fencers of the same nationality in different pools, as far as possible. If a fencer is placed in a pool where there is already a fencer of the same nationality, he is moved one or more places down the ranking until he is placed in a pool without a fencer of the same nationality. If this is not possible, he must remain in the original pool.
3. The order of fencers on the pool sheet is decided by drawing lots.
4. The pools must be fenced up to the last bout.

### o.69

The order of bouts in the pools is as follows:

**Pool of seven:**
```
1–4 5–1 3–5 1–2 5–4 6–4
2–5 4–3 1–6 4–3 1–6 2–3
3–6 6–2 2–4 6–5 3–5 1–4
7–1 5–7 7–3 3–1 4–2 5–2
5–4 3–1 6–5 2–6 5–1 3–6
2–3 4–6 1–2
6–7 7–2 4–7
```

**Pool of six:**
```
1–2 3–1 4–2
3–4 2–4 5–1
5–6 6–3 3–5
2–3 5–2 6–4
4–5 1–6 1–4
6–1 4–6 2–5
```

### o.70

When there are several fencers from the same country in a pool: 

1 If they do not form the majority of the competitors in the pool, they must fence off the bouts between themselves before meeting competitors of another nationality. 

2 If they form the majority of the competitors in the pool, the Directoire Technique may establish a special order of bouts, departing as little as possible from the principle laid down in 3.a) below, in order to obviate excessive fatigue or delays for the competitors who form the minority in the pool. 

3 Examples of the order of fencers of the same nationality in a pool of six: 

a) When a pool contains, among its six fencers, 

- two fencers of the same nationality A , or 

- two fencers of the same nationality A and two of the same nationality B 

- two fencers of the same nationality A, two of the same nationality B and two of the same nationality C 

the fencers’ names are placed on the pool sheet in such a way that those of the same nationality fence each other in their first bout and the order of bouts of a pool of six is that shown in Article o.69 above. 

b) When a pool contains among its six fencers, 

- three fencers of the same nationality A , or 

- three fencers of the same nationality A and two fencers of the same nationality B , or 

- three fencers of the same nationality A and three fencers of the same nationality B , the 

order will be as follows: 

1–2 6–4 4–2

4–5 2–5 3–6

2–3 1–4 5–1

5–6 5–3 3–4

3–1 1–6 6–2

the fencers’ names are placed on the pool sheet in the following way: 

- the fencers of nationality A are given numbers 1, 2 and 3; 

- the fencers of nationality B are given numbers 4 and 5 or 4, 5 and 6.

c) When a pool contains among its six fencers four fencers of the same nationality A and two others of different nationalities, the four fencers of nationality A are placed on the pool sheet as 1, 2, 3 and 4 and the order of bouts in the pool is as follows: 

3–1 1–2 4–5

4–2 3–4 6–2

1–4 1–6 5–1

2–3 2–5 6–4

5–6 3–6 5–3

4 Example of the order of fencers of the same nationality in a pool of seven: 

a) When this pool contains, among the seven fencers, 

- two fencers of nationality A , or 

- two fencers of nationality A and two fencers of nationality B , or 

- two fencers of nationality A, two fencers of nationality B and two fencers of nationality C ,

the fencers of the same nationality are listed on the pool sheet so that they fence their first bout against each other while following the order of fights laid down in Article o.69 above for a pool of seven fencers. 

b) When the pool contains, among the seven fencers, 

- three fencers of nationality A , or 

- three fencers of nationality A and two fencers of nationality B , or 

- three fencers of nationality A, two fencers of nationality B and two fencers of nationality 

C

the three fencers of nationality A must be listed 1, 2 and 3 on the pool sheet, the two fencers of nationality B, 4 and 5, and the two fencers of nationality C, 6 and 7. 

The order of bouts for the pool of seven, detailed in Article o.69, is no longer valid and must be replaced by the following order: 

1–2 6–2 1–4 

4–5 3–4 2–7 

6–7 7–5 5–3 

3–1 1–6 6–4 

4–7 4–2 7–1 

2–3 7–3 2–5 

5–1 5–6 3–6 

### o.71

1 If a bout in a pool is interrupted by an accidental cause , and this interruption is likely to be prolonged, the Referee may (with the consent of the Directoire Technique, or possibly the Organising Committee) alter the order of bouts in such a way as to allow the normal progress of the competition to proceed. 

2 The time allowed for a fencer to rest between two consecutive bouts in a pool is three minutes. 

### o.72

Before the competition starts, the Directoire Technique will decide on and announce the number 

of fencers who will be eliminated based on the ranking established by the pools .

### o.73

1 After the pools, a single general ranking is established of all the fencers who have taken part in the pools, taking account, successively, of the indices V/M, HS – HR , HS .

(V = victories; M = bouts; HS = hits scored; HR = hits received.) 

2 A summary classification table is then made in the following way: 

a) The results written up on the summary table are added up to ascertain the two indices required. 

b) The first index , for the initial classification, is obtained by dividing the number of victories by the number of bouts fought, using the formula V/M.

c) The fencer with the highest index (maximum 1) is seeded first. 

d) In cases of equality in this first index , and to separate fencers with equal first indices, a second index is established, using the formula HS – HR , the difference between the total number of hits scored and hits received. 

e) In cases of equality of the two indices V/M and HS – HR , the fencer who has scored most hits 

is seeded highest. 

f) In cases of absolute equality between two or more fencers, their seeding order is decided by drawing lots. 

3 Should there be absolute equality among the last to qualify there is no barrage, and the fencers with equal indicators are all qualified, even if they are in excess of the number decided on. 

Withdrawal 

### o.74

1 A fencer who is not present at the start of the pool is scratched from the pool and is recorded without a classification at the end of the final classification list with the information “Did Not Start”. 

2 A fencer who abandons in the course of a pool is scratched from the pool and is recorded in the list of results with the information ‘Did Not Finish’ .

3. A fencer who is excluded during the pool phase is scratched from the pool, and his results are annulled as if he had not taken part. The fencer is recorded without a classification at the end of the final classification list with the information “Excluded”. 

### o.75

---------------------

# B. GENERAL RULES FOR THE DIRECT ELIMINATION 

### o.76

The direct elimination table (bout plan) is established taking account of the classification table and the special rules for each competition (see Figure 7a). The principle of protection of nationality will not be applied. 

### o.77

The Organizing committee of a competition must publish the direct elimination bout plan ,showing on it the scheduled time for each bout from the table of 64 onwards. 

### o.78

1 During the one-minute rests a person, named before the bout, may have access to the fencer. 

2 A clock, incorporated into the electrical scoring apparatus, blocks the latter at the end of each period. 

Withdrawal 

### o.79

1 From the beginning of the direct elimination tableau, if for whatever reason, a fencer does not fence, or is unable to fence, or does not complete his bout , his opponent is declared winner of that bout. A fencer who withdraws does not lose his place in the overall classification of the competition and is recorded in the result list with the information “Did Not Finish”. 

2 A fencer who is excluded is scratched from the direct elimination table and his results are annulled as if he had not taken part. The fencer is recorded without a classification at the end of the final classification list with the information “Excluded”. Cf. t.124.3.b, t.170.

Order of bouts 

### o. 80 

1 In each round of the direct elimination table (256, 128, 64, 32, 16, 8 or 4), the bouts are always called in the order of the bout plan , starting at the top and ending at the bottom. 

2 This rule must also be applied for each quarter or eighth of the table , when the direct elimination is taking place simultaneously on 4 or 8 pistes. 

3 A fencer must always be allowed a rest period of ten minutes between two consecutive bouts. 

The final 

### o.81

1 The final, which is by direct elimination, will preferably consist of 4 fencers. 

2 The finals of both women’s and men’s events at the same weapon should preferably be held on the same day. 

Classification 

### o.82

1 The general classification is obtained as follows: 

First: the winner of the bout for the first place 

Second: the loser of the bout for the first place 

2 The two fencers who lose the semi-final matches are placed equal third, when it is not necessary to separate them. 

3 When it is necessary to separate them, a bout for third and fourth places will be fought between the two losers of the semi-final matches. 

4 The remainder are placed, in each round of the tableau: 

a) Competitions with a round of pools: according to the ranking for the drawing of the direct elimination tableau following the pools. 

b) Competitions with no round of pools: according to the ranking preceding the drawing of the initial tableau and before any drawing of lots if that is required. 

5 The fencers eliminated in the round of pools are ranked according to their classification in this 

round and they are placed after those who qualified for the direct elimination. 

# C. MIXED FORMULA A. SENIOR WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS, SENIOR WORLD CUPS AND GRAND PRIX 

Mixed formula A 

### o.83

One qualifying round of pools, a preliminary direct elimination table, a main direct elimination table of 64 fencers to qualify for a final by direct elimination. 

This formula is used for the individual competitions of the Senior World Championships as well as for the Senior World Cup competitions and Grand Prix competitions .

### o.84

Apart from the details that follow, the general rules for pools and direct elimination prescribed above apply. 

### o.85

1 The competition consists of two phases , a preliminary phase and a main phase, each of which are run on one day. 

2 The 16 fencers entered who are ranked highest in the most recent official FIE classification 

are exempt from the preliminary phase.

3 Should a fencer who has been entered not turn up, a fine (cf o.31 , table of financial penalties and fines), payable to the FIE, is inflicted on the Federation of the fencer at fault except in a case of force majeure which is duly justified. 

4 In the case of a tie in the official FIE ranking between two or more fencers for the 16th exempt 

place, lots are drawn to decide which of these fencers will benefit from exemption from the preliminary phase. 

### o.86

1 The preliminary phase consists of one round of pools, from which 20%–30% of the participants 

in the pools are eliminated, based on the indices of all competing in them, and a preliminary direct elimination table. For Grand Prix competitions, the number of fencers eliminated on the indices of the pools must be 30% 

.

2 After the round of pools, the 16 fencers ranked highest on the general index (cf o.73) are 

exempt from the preliminary direct elimination table. Should there be a tie between two or more fencers for the 16th place, there will be a barrage for 5 hits to decide who is ranked 16th. Following the barrage, the ranking of the fencers is determined according to V, HS-HR, HS. 

3 The remainder of the fencers qualifying from the pools will make up a preliminary integral direct 

elimination table . This will be based on the indices of the fencers in all the pools (in the case of 

a tie on indices, the fencers will be separated by drawing lots). This table, be it complete or incomplete, will be fenced until only 32 fencers remain. 

### o.87

1 The main phase consists of an integral direct elimination table, which is fenced on four pistes, 

one quarter of the table per piste. The first round of the table of 64 may, however, if required for the organisation of the competition, be fenced on eight pistes. Grand Prix competitions must be fenced on four pistes. 

2 The seeded fencers exempted from the preliminary phase occupy places 1–16 in this table, 

drawing lots in pairs in the order of their official FIE classification. 

3 Should one of the 16 exempted fencers who had been entered not present himself to fence 

(cf. o.85), his position in the table will remain empty and his federation will be required to pay to the FIE a fine (cf o.31, table of financial penalties and fines) unless his absence is caused by circumstances duly justified as being outside his control. 

4 The 16 fencers who have the highest indices after the round of pools and who are thus 

exempt from the preliminary direct elimination table will take places 17–32, classified in the order of their indices (in the case of a tie on indices, the fencers will be separated by drawing lots). 

5 The 32 fencers qualifying from the preliminary direct elimination table will occupy places 

33–64, classified according to their indices after the round of pools. 

6 The drawing of lots and allocation of the qualified fencers in the main table (T64) shall be made at the end of the preliminary table in the presence of the Directoire Technique President. 

### o.88

There will be no bout for the third place. The two fencers who lose the semi-final matches will be placed equal third .

# D. MIXED FORMULA B – JUNIOR AND CADET WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS 

# AND JUNIOR WORLD CUP COMPETITIONS AND ZONAL CHAMPIONSHIPS. 

Mixed Formula B 

### o.89

One qualifying round of pools, a direct elimination table to qualify for a final by direct elimination.

This formula is used for the individual competitions of the Junior and Cadet World Championships and the Junior World Cup competitions and Zonal Championships. The seeding rules for the Zonal Cadet Championships are established by the Zonal Confederations. 

### o.90

Apart from the details that follow , the general rules for pools and direct elimination described above apply. 

### o.91

The competitions are run on one single day per weapon. 

### o.92

The competition consists of one round of pools , in which all the fencers present take part , and an integral direct elimination table. 

### o.93

1 All the fencers qualifying from the round of pools are placed in a direct elimination table, complete or incomplete, according to the indices resulting from the pools . This table is fenced right through to the final. 

2 From the last 32 the direct elimination bouts will take place: 

- either on 4 pistes , with each quarter of the table fenced on one piste. 

- or on 8 pistes, with each quarter of the table fenced on 2 pistes. 

### o.94

There will be no bout for the third place. The two fencers who lose the semi-final matches will be placed equal third .

# E. FORMULA C. 

## Olympic Games 

### o.95

The organisation formulae for the Olympic Games are established by the Executive Committee, with the approval of the IOC. (See art. 9.1.1.1 of the Administrative rules). 

## Regional Games 

### o.96

The organization formulae for the Regional Games are established by the Executive Committee, with the approval of the IOC. (See chapter 9 of the Administrative rules).

# TEAM COMPETITIONS

## A. SENIOR AND JUNIOR WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS

### o.97

At each weapon, teams consist of three fencers, with or without a reserve. A team may begin a match only if it is complete.

### o.98

1. The competition is run by integral direct elimination with a direct elimination table which may be incomplete (see table Annex b).

2. At the Junior and Senior World Championships, the teams occupy the places in the table according to the most recent official team ranking of the FIE. The teams that are not classified occupy the last places in the table and will be separated by drawing of lots.

3. At the Senior and Junior World Championships, all places in the table up to 16th place are

fought for. From 17th place onwards teams are classified, within each round of the table, according to their initial place in the table. 

### o.99

The formula for the competition is as follows. 

1 The relay formula applies to all weapons. 

2 The three fencers of one team fence the three fencers of the opposing team ( 9 relay bouts ). 

3 The bouts of each match have to be fought in the following order :

3–6 2–5 

1–5 1–4 

2–4 2–6 

1–6 3–5 

3–4 

If this order is altered , intentionally or unintentionally, all the hits scored following the modification are annulled and the match is resumed in the correct order. 

4 The position of each team on the match score-sheet is decided by drawing lots. The order of the individual fencers is then decided by the team captains. 

5

a) In the course of a match the captain of a team may ask to substitute for a fencer the reserve nominated before the start of the match. This substitution may only be made at the end of a bout. However, the fencer who has been replaced may fence one more time during that match, but only to replace the fencer who originally substituted him. This second replacement is not allowed if the first replacement has been made for the reasons listed in article o.99.6. No further substitution for a fencer on the piste is allowed, even in the case of an accident or unavoidable circumstances. 

The announcement that a fencer is to be substituted must be made at the latest before the beginning of the bout preceding the next bout of the fencer who is to be replaced and must be reported by the Referee to the opposing team captain. At World Championships and Olympic Games, the referee must also report this immediately to the Directoire Technique. 

b) If an accident occurs in the bout which follows the request for a substitution, the team captain may annul that request. 

c) If the captain of the opposing team has also requested a substitution, this substitution may be 

implemented or cancelled .

6

a) If a member of a team is obliged to retire during a match as the result of an accident which has been duly recognised by a medical representative of the FIE, the captain of his team may

ask to put in a reserve to continue the match at the point where the competitor who was obliged to retire withdrew, even during a bout in progress. 

b) However, a competitor who is thus replaced cannot again take his place in the team 

during the same match. 

7 a) If both a fencer and the reserve, if any, are forced to withdraw, and the team is therefore incomplete, it has lost the match and must withdraw from the competition. The team retains its place in the final ranking. 

b) If a fencer is excluded during a team match, his/her team has lost the match and the team is excluded from the competition without any final ranking. Cf. t.160. 

7

8 When for any reason whatever a team does not complete an event in which it is taking part, the Directoire Technique will apply the rules laid down for a competitor who does not complete an event in an individual competition, each team being considered in its entirety as being a 

single competitor . Cf. t.124.3.b, t.170. 

9 When a team fails to appear against another team it is considered: 

a) as not completing the event in which it is taking part, if it has already fenced against another team (cf. o.79); 

b) as not competing at all in the event, if it is its first match. 

10 A 10-minute rest must always be given between two matches of the same team. 

# B. SENIOR AND JUNIOR TEAM WORLD CUPS AND ZONAL CHAMPIONSHIPS 

### o.100

Apart from the following aspects, the competition is run in accordance with rules laid down for the team events in the Junior, Senior World Championships and Zonal Championships respectively. 

### o.101

If a team does not begin a match they will be disqualified from the competition and thus will not receive any World Team Cup points, unless this is because of an injury or other medical reason ,duly attested by the duty doctor. 

### o.102

1 The first four teams are placed in the direct elimination table according to the current official team ranking of the FIE (cf. o.109); the remaining ranked teams will be placed in the table by drawing of lots in pairs. 

The teams that are not classified will occupy the last places in the table and will be separated by drawing of lots. 

2 The table will be drawn up based on the ranking of the teams entered, at the latest one hour after the quarter finals of the individual event. 

At the Zonal Championships, teams without FIE ranking will occupy the last places in the table. They will be separated according to the final ranking obtained in the individual competition by the three best fencers in the team. The fencers of the teams who do not have a ranking in the individual competition will take the last place +1. 

### o.103

# ANTI-DOPING 

# Anti-doping testing 

### o.106

An anti-doping test must be carried out at all official competitions of the FIE in accordance with the regulations in Article o.107 and the Anti-Doping Rules of the FIE. It may begin from the start of the competition and applies to fencers who have finished fencing. 

### o.107

1 Doping is forbidden by the FIE. Any breaking of this rule will incur disciplinary action. 

2 Doping is defined as the occurrence of one or more of the anti-doping rule violations set forth in Articles 2.1 to 2.8 of the FIE Anti-Doping Rules. 

3 The FIE has committed itself to the WADA Anti-Doping Code. The FIE Anti-Doping Rules are based on the WADA ‘Models of Best Practice’ and adopt in their entirety the ‘mandatory clauses’ of the above document. The FIE also adopts in full the WADA ‘Prohibited Classes of Substances and Prohibited Methods’ document. 

4 The FIE reserves the right to conduct doping control during competitions — that is, at any competition organised under its control — as well as out-of-competition. 

5 The athletes who participate in FIE competitions undertake to respect the FIE anti-doping Rules, to use neither prohibited substances nor prohibited methods and to agree to submit to any anti-doping control, whether in- or out- of competition; 

6 All the details concerning the doping controls at official FIE competitions, as well as out-of-competition, are to be found in the articles of the Anti-Doping Rules of the FIE. 

7 The penalties and consequences of the penalties arising from violations of the anti-doping rules are those laid down in the Anti-Doping-Rules of the FIE. 

8 Fencers found to have contravened these anti-doping rules will be subject to the procedures provided for in the Anti-Doping Rules. The publication of test results and decisions relating to application of penalties will be announced by the Central Office of the FIE, which alone has the right to bring them to the notice of all member federations. 

9 Doping offences committed and penalised in any of the member countries of the FIE will be taken into account and the penalties (‘sanctions’) will be applied by all member countries of the FIE. 

10 Modification of the FIE Anti-Doping Rules falls within the competence of the Executive Committee. 

# PART D: PROCEDURES AFTER THE COMPETITIONS 

# Chapter 1 

# RANKING 

Official FIE individual ranking 

### o.108

1 Principles 

a) The official Senior ranking of the FIE takes into account the best five results of the World Cup, 

Grand Prix or Satellite competitions in which the fencer has participated, irrespective of continent, plus the World Championships or Olympic Games and the Zonal Championships.

b) The official Junior ranking of the FIE takes into account the best six results of the World Cup 

competitions in which the fencer has participated, irrespective of continent, as well as the World Championships and the Zonal Championships. 

c) For both Senior and Junior rankings, the ranking is rolling. 

The competitions are numbered in order of the dates provided in the calendar and by competition category (World Cup, Grand Prix or Satellite events). 

The points awarded in event 1 of the current season replace the points awarded in event 1 of the previous season and so on. 

If an event is cancelled during the current season, the points acquired during the corresponding event of the previous season will be deleted on the date assigned to this event in the calendar of the current season. 

d) In the event of equal points , the ranking is based on who has gained the most first places, then 

second places, etc. 

If there is a complete tie, the fencers are ranked equal. 

e) After each competition which is taken into account to establish the ranking, this is updated automatically after verification of the results by the FIE. 

f) Except where special rules apply, the official up-to-date FIE ranking is the deciding factor for all rankings, seedings, exemptions, etc. 

2. **Scale of points**

   a) The ranking of Seniors and Juniors is based on the following points system:

   | Placement | Points |
   |-----------|--------|
   | 1st place | 32 points |
   | 2nd place | 26 points |
   | 3rd place (ex aequo) | 20 points |
   | 5th – 8th places | 14 points |
   | 9th – 16th places | 8 points |
   | 17th – 32nd places | 4 points |
   | 33rd – 64th places | 2 points |
   | 65th – 96th places | 1 point |
   | 97th - 128th | 0.5 point |
   | 129th - 256th | 0.25 point |

b) Points obtained in an individual World Cup competition are multiplied by a factor of 1. 

c) Points obtained in a Grand Prix and a Zonal Championship competition of the FIE are multiplied by a factor of 1.5. 

d) Points obtained in the individual events of the Senior World Championships and in the Junior 

World Championships are multiplied by a factor of 2.5. 

e) Points obtained in the individual events of the Olympic Games are multiplied by a factor of 3.0. 

At the Olympic Games, fourth place is awarded 54 points. 

f) Only fencers who have actually participated in a direct elimination table can receive any points. 
3 Honours 

The winner (first ranked fencer) of each senior official ranking of the FIE will be announced at 

the end of the Senior World Championships or Olympic Games.

The winner (first ranked fencer) of each junior official ranking will be announced at the end of the Junior World Championships. 

### o.109

1 Official team ranking of the FIE 

2 Principle 

a) The official Senior team ranking of the FIE takes into account a team’s best four results in the Senior Team World Cup competitions, irrespective of continent, plus the Senior World Championships or the Olympic Games and the Zonal Championships. 

The official Junior team ranking of the FIE takes into account a team’s best four results in the Junior Team World Cup competitions, irrespective of continent, plus the Junior World Championships and the Zonal Championships. 

The official team ranking of the FIE is rolling and updated on a permanent basis :

Team World Cup events are numbered in order of their scheduled dates in the calendar. 

The points awarded in Event 1 of the current season replace the points awarded in Event 1 of the 

previous season and so on. 

If an event is cancelled during the current season, the points acquired in the corresponding event 

of the previous season will be deleted on the date allocated to that event in the current season's 

calendar. 

b) Should several teams have equal points , the same rules shall apply as for the official FIE individual ranking (cf. o.108) 

c) Except where special rules apply, the updated official team ranking is the deciding factor for all rankings, seedings, etc. 

2 Team scale of points 

a) The ranking will be based on the following scale of points: 

1st place 64 points 10th place 24 points 

2nd place 52 points 11th place 23 points 

3rd place 40 points 12th place 22 points 

4th place 36 points 13th place 21 points 

5th place 32 points 14th place 20 points 

6th place 30 points 15th place 19 points 

7th place 28 points 16th place 18 points 

8th place 26 points 17th –32nd 8 points 

9th place 25 points 33rd to 64th 4 points 

b) For the World Team Championships, the points indicated above are multiplied by two. 

c) Points obtained in a Zonal Team Championship have a factor of 1.0. 

3 Honours 

The winner (first ranked team) of each official Junior and Senior team ranking of the FIE will be 

announced at the end of the Senior World Championships or Olympic Games.

## VETERANS TEAM EVENTS

### o.119

1 Participation 

Each country may enter one team per gender and per weapon, thus giving a total of 6 competitions. 

The teams shall be composed of fencers who participated in the individual competition of the corresponding weapon, but c.f. o.103.2 b below. 

2 The rules for team competitions are applicable with the following exceptions: 

a) For each weapon, the teams are composed of three fencers of the same nationality, one from category "A", one from "B" and one from "C", with or without a reserve for each category. A team cannot begin the match if it is not complete. 

b) In the case of a team being short of a fencer in any of the weapons, the team may use a fencer who has competed in the individual championships at another weapon or who is registered but has yet to compete, but his/her ranking will be deemed to be last in the individual competition at the weapon of the team in which he is going to fence plus 1. 

c) The teams are placed in the pools according to the ranking of the three fencers in the individual championship. The team ranked 1 is the one having the lowest total. All the fencers registered for the team event must be present at the piste before the start of each match. 

d) Each team may request, before a given relay, the substitution of a fencer. However, in case of injury or other medical reason duly recognized by the Medical delegate, the substitution can be immediate, even during the relay. 

There can only be one substitution per team per match. 

3 A fencer who has been replaced because of an injury may not fence again during that match. If both a fencer and the reserve are forced to retire, or if a fencer is excluded, their team is deemed to have lost the match. 

4 The relay system is always applied. The three fencers of a team fence against their opponent of the same category. Each fencer fences his/her opponent twice giving a total of 6 relays. The relays are for 5 hits (5-10-15-20- etc.). Exceptionally, a relay may end at more than 5,10,15 etc. if a fencer scores a valid last hit of the relay and is at the same time awarded an additional penalty hit: in this case both hits will be counted; the maximum time for each relays is 3 minutes. 

5 The team that first reaches the maximum score of 30 hits, or that which has scored the greatest number of hits after the expiry of regulation time, is the winner. 

6 The order of categories for each match is established by the referee with the captains on the piste prior to the start of the match: The referee will draw lots and the winning captain will choose the first category in the order. The losing captain will choose the second category. 

7 The competition consists of a round of pools of 3 or 4 teams, in which all the teams participate, and a direct elimination phase for the highest placed 16 teams; the other teams will be classified according to their ranking after the round of pools.

a) The order of matches in a pool of 4 is as follows: 

Match 1 : The team ranked 1 vs the team ranked 4 

Match 2 : The team ranked 2 vs the team ranked 3 

Match 3 : The winner of Match 1 vs the loser of Match 2 

Match 4 : The winner of Match 2 vs the loser of Match 1 

Match 5 and Match 6 : The two remaining matches. 

b) The order of matches in a pool of 3 is as follows: 

Match 1 : The team ranked 2 vs the team ranked 3 

Match 2 : The team ranked 1 vs the loser of Match 1 

Match 3 : The team ranked 1 vs the winner of Match 1 

The initial ranking on which the drawing of the pools is based is established from the results of the fencers in the individual events. (cf. o.103.2.c) 

The composition of the direct elimination table of 16 teams (or 8 if there are less than 16 teams) is established according to the general ranking established by the results of all the teams in the pool round. In the event of an absolute tie between the teams ranked 16 and 17 (or 8 and 9), the highest ranked team in the initial pool ranking shall qualify. 

However, in no case, teams which have already fenced each other in the pools should meet again immediately in the direct elimination. To avoid this, the lower ranked of the two teams in question may be moved: 

- in the case of a tableau of 16, the team ranked 9 may change places only with the team ranked 10, the team ranked 11 may change places only with the team ranked 12, the team ranked 13 may change places only with the team ranked 14 and the team ranked 15 may change places only with the team ranked 16. 

- in the case of a tableau of 8, the team ranked 5 may change places only with the team ranked 6 and the team ranked 7 may change places only with the team ranked 8. 

8 If fewer than 6 teams participate in the competition, they all fence in a pool unique; a match for the 3rd and 4th places is then held, followed by a match for the first place between the teams who came 1st and 2nd in the pool. 

9 Ranking matches from 5th place onwards will not be fenced and teams will be ranked, in each round of the table, according to their ranking after the pools. 

1. Participation 

Each country may enter one team per category (Veterans and Grand Veterans) per gender and per weapon, thus giving a total of twelve competitions. 

The teams shall be composed of fencers who participated in the individual competition of the corresponding weapon, but c.f. o.103.2 b below. 

2. The rules for team competitions are applicable with the following exceptions: 

Veterans: teams of three composed of fencers belonging to either age group 40-49 or to age group 50-59, with at least one fencer belonging to age group 50-59, plus up to two reserves. 

Grand Veterans: teams of three composed of fencers belonging to either age group 60-69 or to age group 70 and over, with at least one fencer belonging to age group 70 and over, plus up to two reserves. 

Fencing mode is 45 hits relay described in o.99 with application of non-combativity rule at any match. 

The competition begins with a round of pools of 3 and 4 teams -established according to o.103 c) - and followed by a direct elimination phase according to o.103 7. 

Particular cases depending on the number of teams:

• only 1 team: the organisers must inform all nations that there will be no competition at that weapon. 

• 2 teams: only one match between these two teams. 

• 3 teams: one poule of three followed by D.E. from an incomplete tableau of 4. 

• 4 teams: one poule of four followed by D.E. from a tableau of 4. 

• 5 teams: one poule of five followed by D.E. from an incomplete tableau of 8. 

The losers of the semi-finals have to fence for the bronze medal. 

a) In the case of a team being short of a fencer in any of the weapons, the team may use a fencer who has competed in the individual championships at another weapon or who is registered but has yet to compete, but his/her ranking will be deemed to be last in the individual competition at the weapon of the team in which he is going to fence plus 1. 

b) The teams are placed in the pools according to the ranking of the three fencers in the individual championship. The number 1 team is the one with the least points. All the fencers registered for the team event must be present at the piste before the start of each match. 

c) Each team may request, before a given relay, the substitution of a fencer. However, in case of injury or other medical reason, duly recognized by the medical delegate, the substitution can be immediate, even during the relay. 

There can be up to two substitutions of reserves per match but must maintain compliance with the age category representation requirement. 

Application : during the test at the 2025 World Championships (not applicable in 2023 and 2024).
